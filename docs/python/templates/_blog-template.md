Hook the reader in with why this matters to them and a preview of your result. Think of the inverted pyramind - lead with the best stuff, and drill down into details in the rest of your post.

<!--truncate-->

'authors' includes your GitHub username. Please make sure you have an updated profile picture.
'tags' - refer to the list of tags on the Deephaven content calendar or index page.

[Links](/core/docs/reference/table-operations/join/natural-join/) are a bit different and do not include the extension. To link to another blog post, use [this format](/blog/2021/11/22/deephaven-prometheus/).

If you need to add images or gifs, make a new folder for your blog in the Blog Assets folder. Note that the markdown for .png and .gif files is the same.

Anything longer than 10 seconds should be an .mp4 file instead of a .gif or .png, as in this looped video:

<LoopedVideo src='../assets/recently_pub.mp4' />

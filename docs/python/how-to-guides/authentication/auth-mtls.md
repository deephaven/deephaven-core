title: Configure mTLS for Deephaven
sidebar_label: mTLS
---

This guide will show you how to configure Deephaven to use mTLS to authenticate users trying to gain access.

Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) is an authentication method that ensures data security through both parties authenticating each other simultaneously. With mTLS, authentication happens through certificates, where a certificate authority determines what certificates are valid, and which are not. Once both parties are verified, the authentication is complete.

Configuring Deephaven to use mTLS to guard against unauthorized access requires a custom setup with a few extra steps.

## Configuration

mTLS authentication requires some extra configuration on top of Deephaven's basic setup. The majority of the setup requires configuration of the Deephaven Docker application. You will need a Dockerfile that adds the required JAR file to the Deephaven classpath, a docker-compose YAML file that sets some additional properties, and the necessary certificates.

## Example

### Dockerfile

First, create a Dockerfile from which the Deephaven application will be built. It will add the required JAR file to the Deephaven classpath. Specify which version of deephaven-core you are using in your Dockerfile; the following example Dockerfile uses version 0.36.0.

```Dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/deephaven/server:0.36.0
ADD https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/deephaven/deephaven-mtls-authentication-provider/0.36.0/deephaven-mtls-authentication-provider-0.36.0.jar /apps/libs/
```

### docker-compose.yml

Next, create a docker-compose file. It will look like this:

```yaml
services:
  deephaven:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "${DEEPHAVEN_PORT:-8443}:8443"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    environment:
      - START_OPTS=-Xmx4g -DAuthHandlers=io.deephaven.authentication.mtls.MTlsAuthenticationHandler -Dssl.identity.type=privatekey -Dssl.identity.certChainPath=/data/certs/server.chain.crt -Dssl.identity.privateKeyPath=/data/certs/server.key -Dssl.trust.type=certs -Dssl.trust.path=/data/certs/ca.crt -Dssl.clientAuthentication=NEEDED -Dhttp.port=8443
```

There's a lot of text in the `environment`. Here's what it all means:

- `-Xmx4g`: Give Deephaven 4GB of memory.
- `-DAuthHandlers=io.deephaven.authentication.mtls.MTlsAuthenticationHandler`: Tell Deephaven that it will use mTLS to authenticate users.
- `-Dssl.identity.type=privatekey`: A private key will be used to verify identity.
- `-Dssl.identity.certChainPath=/data/certs/server.chain.crt`: The cert chain path can be found in `/data/certs`.
- `-Dssl.identity.privateKeyPath=/data/certs/server.key`: The private key can be found at `/data/certs/server.key`.
- `-Dssl.trust.type=certs`: Certificates are used.
- `-Dssl.trust.path=/data/certs/ca.crt`: The certificate authority is found at `/data/certs/ca.crt`.
- `-Dssl.clientAuthentication=NEEDED`: Any client trying to connect **must** use mTLS with a certificate to do so.
- `-Dhttp.port=8443`: The process happens over port 8443.

Keeping certificates and keys in `/data/certs` isn't the most secure storage method. For more information on best security practices with Docker, see [How to use secrets in Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/use-secrets/).

### Certificates

There are several required files listed above. These files are keys, certificates, and more. Creating them is a topic outside the coverage of this document. For more information on creating self-signed certificates, see this [README](https://github.com/deephaven/deephaven-core/blob/main/server/dev-certs/README.md). For more information on creating certificates that are not self-signed, use an external resource.

Place these files within `/data/certs`, or wherever within the Deephaven container you've chosen to place them.

### Start Deephaven

Since Deephaven is being built from an image rather than pulled directly, start Deephaven as such:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Navigate to `https://localhost:8443` in your browser. If you're met with a warning about security, it's because you're using self-signed certificates. You can click to approve or switch to using certificates accepted by your browser.

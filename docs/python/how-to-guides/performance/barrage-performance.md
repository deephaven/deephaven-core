Barrage is the name of Deephaven's IPC table transport. This guide explains what statistics are recorded and how to access them.

## Access Barrage metrics tables

You can access these tables as follows:

```python order=null
import jpy

bpl = jpy.get_type(
    "io.deephaven.extensions.barrage.BarragePerformanceLog"
).getInstance()

subs = bpl.getSubscriptionTable()
snaps = bpl.getSnapshotTable()
```

This is what the subscriptions table looks like when there are live subscriptions:

This is what the snapshots table looks like after processing a few requests:

### Barrage subscription metrics summary

Subscription statistics are presented in percentiles bucketed over a time period. Here are the various metrics that are recorded by the Deephaven server:

| Stat Type             | Sender / Receiver | Description                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| EnqueueMillis         | Sender            | The time it took to record changes that occurred during a single update graph cycle |
| AggregateMillis       | Sender            | The time it took to aggregate multiple updates within the same interval             |
| PropagateMillis       | Sender            | The time it took to deliver an aggregated message to all subscribers                |
| SnapshotMillis        | Sender            | The time it took to snapshot data for a new or changed subscription                 |
| UpdateJobMillis       | Sender            | The time it took to run one full cycle of the off-thread propagation logic          |
| WriteMillis           | Sender            | The time it took to write the update to a single subscriber                         |
| WriteMegabits         | Sender            | The payload size of the update in megabits                                          |
| DeserializationMillis | Receiver          | The time it took to read and deserialize the update from the wire                   |
| ProcessUpdateMillis   | Receiver          | The time it took to apply a single update during the update graph cycle             |
| RefreshMillis         | Receiver          | The time it took to apply all queued updates during a single update graph cycle     |

### Barrage snapshot metrics summary

Snapshot statistics are presented once per request.

| Stat Type      | Description                                                             |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| QueueMillis    | The time it took waiting for a thread to process the request            |
| SnapshotMillis | The time it took to construct a consistent snapshot of the source table |
| WriteMillis    | The time it took to write the snapshot                                  |
| WriteMegabits  | The payload size of the snapshot in megabits                            |

## Identify a table

Tables are identified by their `TableId` and `TableKey`. The `TableId` is determined by the source table's [`System.identityHashCode()`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/System.html#identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)). The `TableKey` defaults to [`Table.getDescription()`](https://deephaven.io/core/javadoc/io/deephaven/engine/table/Table.html#getDescription()) but can be overridden by setting the table attribute via [`with_attributes`](/core/pydoc/code/deephaven.table.html#deephaven.table.Table.with_attributes).

```python order=t,:log
import jpy
from deephaven import empty_table

system = jpy.get_type("java.lang.System")

t = empty_table(0)

identity_hashcode = system.identityHashCode(t.j_table)

print(f"TableId: {identity_hashcode}")

table = jpy.get_type("io.deephaven.engine.table.Table")
attr_table = t.with_attributes({table.BARRAGE_PERFORMANCE_KEY_ATTRIBUTE: "MyTableKey"})
```

> [!NOTE]
> The web client applies transformations to every table to which it subscribes. If a table is also subscribed to by a non-web client, then statistics for the original table and the transformed table will both appear in the metrics table. Their `TableId` will differ. Most transformations clear the `TableKey` attribute, such as when a column is sorted or filtered, both programmatically and through the GUI.

## Extra configuration

Here are server-side flags that change the behavior of Barrage metrics.

- `-DBarragePerformanceLog.enableAll`: record metrics for tables that do not have an explicit `TableKey` (default: `true`)
- `-DBarragePerformanceLog.cycleDurationMillis`: the interval to flush aggregated statistics (default: `60000` - once per minute)

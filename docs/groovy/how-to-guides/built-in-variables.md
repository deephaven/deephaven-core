There are three special built-in query language variables worth noting. They correspond to row indices in tables.

- `i` is a 32-bit integer representing the current row index.
- `ii` is a 64-bit integer representing the current row index.
- `k` is a 64-bit integer representing a special internal indexing value.

`i` and `ii` can be used to access the current, previous, and subsequent rows in a table.

> [!WARNING]
> `k` is a Deephaven engine index and does not correspond to traditional row indices. It is used for Deephaven engine development and should _only_ be used in limited circumstances, such as debugging or advanced query operations.

> [!WARNING]
> These built-in variables are not reliable in ticking tables. They should only be used in static cases.

## Usage

The following code block shows how to use `i` and `ii` in a query:

```groovy order=source
source = emptyTable(10).update(
    "RowIndex32Bit = i", "RowIndex64Bit = ii", "EngineIndex64Bit = k"
)
```

_I have a client query that gives an error `Received message larger than max`. How can I fix this?_

[gRPC](https://grpc.io) has a default maximum message size of 4MB, but Deephaven clients have a default maximum size of 100MB. Attempting to send messages larger than 100MB will result in an error. To fix this, you should either:

- Reduce message sizes by breaking them into smaller chunks.
- Increase the maximum message size on both the client and server.

For the latter, refer to [`Grpc_arg_keys`](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/core/group__grpc__arg__keys.html) for available options. The relevant keys are:

- `GRPC_ARG_MAX_RECEIVE_MESSAGE_LENGTH`
- `GRPC_ARG_MAX_SEND_MESSAGE_LENGTH`

For the Groovy client, you can set these options when constructing the session via the [`maxInboundMessageSize`](https://docs.deephaven.io/core/javadoc/io/deephaven/client/impl/ClientConfig.html#maxInboundMessageSize()) method:

```groovy skip-test
import io.deephaven.client.ClientConfig
import io.deephaven.uri.DeephavenTarget

def target = DeephavenTarget.of(URI.create("dh://localhost:10000"))
def clientConfig = ClientConfig.builder()
    .target(target)
    .maxInboundMessageSize(200 * 1024 * 1024) // Increases limit from 100MB to 200MB
    .build()
```

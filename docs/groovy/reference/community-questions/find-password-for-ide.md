<em>I started a Deephaven server. I want to connect to the IDE via my web browser, but it's asking me for a password I didn't set. Where can I find the password?</em>

If you didn't set the password, you can't find it. When starting a server, either [set the key yourself](../../how-to-guides/authentication/auth-psk.md#setting-your-own-key) or use [anonymous authentication](../../how-to-guides/authentication/auth-anon.md).

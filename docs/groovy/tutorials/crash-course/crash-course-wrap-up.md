## Where to go from here

This wraps up the Deephaven crash course. In it, you learned about:

- Deephaven's basic architecture
- Table constructors
- Table operations
- Query strings
- Plotting
- Data I/O

This guide is your springboard into deeper exploration and utilization of Deephaven's powerful features in your real-time data analysis endeavors. Remember, this is just the beginning of your journey with Deephaven. To continue learning about Deephaven, check out any of these links:

<!--TODO: when they exist in Groovy, add Table Listeners, Execute SQL queries, and Generate Query Strings, plotting Index-->

As you integrate these concepts into your work, you'll unlock new levels of efficiency and insight in your data science projects and real-time analytics.

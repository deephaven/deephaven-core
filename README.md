# Deephaven Community Core

![Deephaven Data Labs Logo](docs/images/Deephaven_GH_Logo.svg)

Deephaven Community Core is a real-time, time-series, column-oriented analytics engine
with relational database features.
Queries can seamlessly operate upon both historical and real-time data.
Deephaven includes an intuitive user experience and visualization tools.
It can ingest data from a variety of sources, apply computation and analysis algorithms
to that data, and build rich queries, dashboards, and representations with the results.

Deephaven Community Core is an open version of [Deephaven Enterprise](https://deephaven.io),
which functions as the data backbone for prominent hedge funds, banks, and financial exchanges.

## Run Deephaven

This section is a quick start guide for running Deephaven from pre-built images.  Almost all users will want to run Deephaven using pre-built images.  It is the easiest way to deploy.  For detailed instructions, see [Launch Deephaven from pre-built images](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/tutorials/quickstart).

Developers interested in tinkering with and modifying source code should build from the source code. For detailed instructions on how to do this, see [Build and launch Deephaven](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/launch-build).

If you are not sure which of the two is right for you, use the pre-built images.

### Required Dependencies

Running Deephaven requires a few software packages.

| Package        | Version                       | OS           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------ |
| docker         | ^20.10.8                      | All          |
| docker-compose | ^1.29.0                       | All          |
| Windows        | 10 (OS build 20262 or higher) | Only Windows |
| WSL            | 2                             | Only Windows |

You can check if these packages are installed and functioning by running:
```
docker version
docker-compose version
docker run hello-world
```

> :warning: **On Windows, all commands must be run inside a WSL 2 terminal.**

If any dependencies are missing or unsupported versions are installed, see [Launch Deephaven from pre-built images](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/tutorials/quickstart#prerequisites) for installation instructions.


### Create deployment

A directory must be created to store files and mount points for your deployment.  Here, we are using the `deephaven-deployment` directory.  

You will need to `cd` into the deployment directory to launch or interact with the deployment.

```bash
mkdir deephaven-deployment
cd deephaven-deployment
```

> :warning: **Commands in the following sections for interacting with a deployment must be run from the deployment directory.**

```

### Monitor logs

The `-d` option to `docker-compose` causes the containers to run in the background, in detached mode.  This option allows you to use your shell after Docker launches the containers.

Since the container is running detached, you will not see any logs. However, you can follow the logs by running:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

Use CTRL+C to stop monitoring the logs and return to a prompt.

### Shutdown

The deployment can be brought down by running:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Manage example data

[Deephaven's examples repository](https://github.com/deephaven/examples) contains data sets that are useful when learning 
to use Deephaven. These data sets are used extensively in Deephaven's documentation and are needed to run some examples. [Deephaven's examples repository](https://github.com/deephaven/examples) contains documentation on the available data sets and how to manage them. 

If you have chosen a deployment with example data, the example data sets will be downloaded. Production deployments containing your own data will not need the example data sets.


To upgrade a deployment to the latest example data, run:

```bash
docker-compose run examples download
```

To see what other example data management commands are available, run:

```bash
docker-compose run examples
```

If your deployment does not have example data, these commands will fail with `ERROR: No such service`.


## Run Deephaven IDE

Once Deephaven is running, you can launch a Deephaven IDE in your web browser.  Deephaven IDE allows you to interactively analyze data.

- If Deephaven is running locally, navigate to [http://localhost:10000/ide/](http://localhost:10000/ide/).
- If Deephaven is running remotely, navigate to `http://<hostname>:10000/ide/`, where `<hostname>` is the address of the machine Deephaven is running on.

# First query

From the Deephaven IDE, you can perform your first query.

This script creates two small tables: one for employees and one for departments.
It joins the two tables on the DeptID column to show the name of the department
where each employee works.

```python

from deephaven.TableTools import newTable, stringCol, intCol
from deephaven.conversion_utils import NULL_INT

left = newTable(
        stringCol("LastName", "Rafferty", "Jones", "Steiner", "Robins", "Smith", "Rogers"),
        intCol("DeptID", 31, 33, 33, 34, 34, NULL_INT),
        stringCol("Telephone", "(347) 555-0123", "(917) 555-0198", "(212) 555-0167", "(952) 555-0110", None, None)
    )

right = newTable(
        intCol("DeptID", 31, 33, 34, 35),
        stringCol("DeptName", "Sales", "Engineering", "Clerical", "Marketing"),
        stringCol("Telephone", "(646) 555-0134", "(646) 555-0178", "(646) 555-0159", "(212) 555-0111")
    )

t = left.join(right, "DeptID", "DeptName,DeptTelephone=Telephone")
```

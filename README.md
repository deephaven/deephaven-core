# Deephaven Community Core

![Deephaven Data Labs Logo](docs/images/Deephaven_GH_Logo.svg)

Deephaven Community Core is a real-time, time-series, column-oriented analytics engine
with relational database features.
Queries can seamlessly operate upon both historical and real-time data.
Deephaven includes an intuitive user experience and visualization tools.
It can ingest data from a variety of sources, apply computation and analysis algorithms
to that data, and build rich queries, dashboards, and representations with the results.

Deephaven Community Core is the open version of [Deephaven Enterprise](https://deephaven.io),
which functions as the data backbone for prominent hedge funds, banks, and financial exchanges.

## Installation

Deephaven Community Core can be used from both server- and client-side APIs. Server-side APIs allow users to connect directly to the Deephaven server and execute commands, write queries, and much more. Client-side APIs allow users to connect to a Deephaven server through a client application.

See the following documentation links for installation instructions and more:

- Python
  - [Run from Docker](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/tutorials/quickstart/)
  - [pip-installed](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/tutorials/quickstart-pip/)
- Groovy
  - [Run from Docker](https://deephaven.io/core/groovy/docs/tutorials/quickstart/)
- [Python client](https://pypi.org/project/pydeephaven/)
- [Java client](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/java-client/)
- [JS client](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/js-api/documentation/)
- [Go client](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/deephaven/deephaven-core/go)
- [R client](https://github.com/deephaven/deephaven-core/blob/main/R/rdeephaven/README.md)

Deephaven's client APIs use [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), [protobuf](https://github.com/deephaven/deephaven-core/tree/main/proto/proto-backplane-grpc/src/main/proto/deephaven/proto), [Apache Arrow Flight](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Flight.html), and [Barrage](https://github.com/deephaven/barrage) to handle ticking data. Users who wish to build their own client APIs can use these tools to do so.

## Run the Deephaven server

### From Docker

This is the easiest way to get started with Deephaven. For full instructions, see our [quickstart for Docker](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/tutorials/quickstart/).

TL;DR:

```sh
# Python
docker run --rm --name deephaven -p 10000:10000 ghcr.io/deephaven/server:latest
```

```sh
# Groovy
docker run --rm name deephaven -p 10000:10000 ghcr.io/deephaven/server-slim:latest
```

### From Python

Users who wish to avoid using Docker will likely want to use [pip-installed Deephaven](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/tutorials/quickstart-pip/).

TL;DR

```sh
pip install deephaven-server deephaven-ipywidgets
```

Then, from Python:

```python
from deephaven_server import Server
s = Server(port=10000, jvm_args=["-Xmx4g"]).start()
```

### Built from source

Users who wish to modify source code and contribute to the project should build Deephaven from source. For full instructions, see [how to build Deephaven from source](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/launch-build/).

TL;DR for Python:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/deephaven/deephaven-core.git
cd deephaven-core
python -m venv /tmp/my-dh-venv
source /tmp/my-dh-venv/bin/activate
./gradlew py-server:assemble
pip install "py/server/build/wheel/deephaven_core-<version>-py3-non-any.whl[autocomplete]
./gradlew server-jetty-app:run
```

TL;DR for Groovy:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/deephaven/deephaven-core.git
cd deephaven-core
./gradlew server-jetty-app:run -Pgroovy
```

### Required dependencies

Building and running Deephaven requires a few software packages.

| Package        | Version                       | OS           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------ |
| git            | ^2.25.0                       | All          |
| java           | >=11, <20                     | All          |
| docker         | ^20.10.8                      | All          |
| docker-compose | ^1.29.0                       | All          |
| Windows        | 10 (OS build 20262 or higher) | Only Windows |
| WSL            | 2                             | Only Windows |

You can check if these packages are installed and functioning by running:

```bash
git version
java -version
docker version
docker-compose version
docker run hello-world
```

:::note

Internally, the Java build process will use [Gradle Auto Provisioning](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html#sec:provisioning)
to download and use the appropriate Java version for building and testing.

On Windows, all commands must be run inside a WSL 2 terminal.

### Authentication

Deephaven, by default, uses pre-shared key authentication to authenticate against unauthorized access. For more information on supported authentication methods:

- [How to configure and use pre-shared key authentication](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/authentication/auth-psk/)
- [How to configure and use anonymous authentication](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/authentication/auth-anon/)
- [How to configure and use username/password authentication](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/authentication/auth-uname-pw/)
- [How to configure and use mTLS authentication](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/authentication/auth-mtls/)
- [How to configure and use Keycload/OpenID authentication](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/authentication/auth-keycloak/)

If using a randomly generated pre-shared key, you can find the key in the server logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f | grep "access through pre-shared key"
```

### Connect to the server

Deephaven is run from a web browser, and can be connected to via `http://localhost:10000/ide`. If using authentication, enter credentials to gain access to the IDE.

## First query

From the Deephaven IDE, you can perform your first query.

This Python script creates two small tables: one for employees and one for departments.
It joins the two tables on the DeptID column to show the name of the department
where each employee works.

```python
from deephaven import new_table
from deephaven.column import string_col, int_col
from deephaven.constants import NULL_INT

left = new_table([
        string_col("LastName", ["Rafferty", "Jones", "Steiner", "Robins", "Smith", "Rogers"]),
        int_col("DeptID", [31, 33, 33, 34, 34, NULL_INT]),
        string_col("Telephone", ["(347) 555-0123", "(917) 555-0198", "(212) 555-0167", "(952) 555-0110", None, None])
    ])

right = new_table([
        int_col("DeptID", [31, 33, 34, 35]),
        string_col("DeptName", ["Sales", "Engineering", "Clerical", "Marketing"]),
        string_col("Telephone", ["(646) 555-0134", "(646) 555-0178", "(646) 555-0159", "(212) 555-0111"])
    ])

t = left.join(right, "DeptID", "DeptName, DeptTelephone=Telephone")
```

# Deephaven Community Core

![Deephaven Data Labs Logo](docs/images/Deephaven_GH_Logo.svg)

Deephaven Community Core is a real-time, time-series, column-oriented analytics engine 
with relational database features.
Queries can seamlessly operate upon both historical and real-time data. 
Deephaven includes an intuitive user experience and visualization tools. 
It can ingest data from a variety of sources, apply computation and analysis algorithms 
to that data, and build rich queries, dashboards, and representations with the results.

Deephaven Community Core is an open version of [Deephaven Enterprise](https://deephaven.io), 
which functions as the data backbone for prominent hedge funds, banks, and financial exchanges.

## Running Deephaven

### Required Dependencies

Building and running Deephaven requires a few software packages.
1. `git`
2. `java`
3. `docker`
4. `docker-compose`
5. (Windows) [WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)

You can check if these packages are installed and functioning by running:
```
git version
java -version
docker-compose version
docker run hello-world
```

<details>
  <summary>Installing Java...</summary>
   
  Deephaven can be built with either [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html)
   or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/install/).  Java 8 is required.  To install Java, run  
  * Mac
      ```
      brew install openjdk@8
      ```
      OpenJDK 8 may need to be added to your path:
      ```
      echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openjdk@8/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
      ```
  * Windows WSL2 - Ubuntu
      ```
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk-headless
      ```
  * Linux
      ```
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk
      ```
    or
      ```
      sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk
      ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Installing Docker...</summary>
 
  Instructions for installing and configuring Docker can be found at 
  [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).  Windows users should follow the WSL2 
  instructions.
  
  Instructions for installing and configuring `docker-compose` can be found at 
  [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
  Version 1.29 (or newer) is required.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Docker RAM settings...</summary>

  Tests run as part of the build process require at least 4GB of Docker RAM.  To check your Docker configuration, run:
  ```
  docker info | grep Memory
  ```
  
  By default, Docker on Mac is configured with 2 GB of RAM.  If you need to increase the memory on your Mac, click
  on the Docker icon on the top bar and navigate to `Preferences->Resources->Memory`.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>If <code>docker run hello-world</code> does not work...</summary>

  If `docker run hello-world` does not work, try the following:
  1. [Is Docker running?](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/#check-whether-docker-is-running)
      ```
      docker info
     ```
  2. (Linux) [Are you in the `docker` user group?](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)
      ```
      sudo groupadd docker
      sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
      ```
</details>


### Checkout & Build Deephaven

Once all of the required dependencies are installed and functioning, run:
```
    git clone git@github.com:deephaven/deephaven-core.git
    cd deephaven-core
    ./gradlew prepareCompose
    docker-compose build
```
These commands will create:
 1. a `deephaven-core` directory containing the source code.
 2. Docker images containing everything needed to launch Deephaven.
 
### Run Deephaven Database

From the `deephaven-core` directory, run
```
    docker-compose up
```
This will start the database.  The console will fill with status and logging output.

Killing the process (e.g. `Ctrl+C`) will stop Deephaven.  

### Run Deephaven IDE

Once Deephaven Database is running, you can launch a Deephaven IDE in your web browser.  Deephaven IDE allows you
to interactively analyze data and develop new analytics.

- If Deephaven Database is running locally,
navigate to [http://localhost:10000/ide/](http://localhost:10000/ide/).  
- If Deephaven Database is running remotely, navigate
to `http://<hostname>:10000/ide/`, where `<hostname>` is the address of the machine Deephaven Database is running on.

# First Query

From the Deephaven IDE, you can perform your first query.  

This script creates two small tables: one for employees and one for departments. 
It joins the two tables on the DeptID column to show the name of the department 
where each employee works.

```python

from deephaven.TableTools import newTable, stringCol, intCol
from deephaven.conversion_utils import NULL_INT

left = newTable(
        stringCol("LastName", "Rafferty", "Jones", "Steiner", "Robins", "Smith", "Rogers"),
        intCol("DeptID", 31, 33, 33, 34, 34, NULL_INT),
        stringCol("Telephone", "(347) 555-0123", "(917) 555-0198", "(212) 555-0167", "(952) 555-0110", None, None)
    )

right = newTable(
        intCol("DeptID", 31, 33, 34, 35),
        stringCol("DeptName", "Sales", "Engineering", "Clerical", "Marketing"),
        stringCol("Telephone", "(646) 555-0134", "(646) 555-0178", "(646) 555-0159", "(212) 555-0111")
    )

t = left.join(right, "DeptID", "DeptName,DeptTelephone=Telephone")
```

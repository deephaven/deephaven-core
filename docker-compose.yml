# Simple draft docker-compose that works with the existing enterprise codebase
# to demonstrate how this could eventually look in OSS. Note that as of this
# commit, the JS doesn't actually work, so we while we can't connect, you can
# still make demo calls to see if they function.
#
# The purpose of this file is to showcase how localhost deployments probably
# will work in lieu of the user installing a self-signed cert into their
# browser - a websocket will be used in place of each http/2 stream, with a
# proxy to provide this (one needed per worker) and an envoy instance to
# reverse proxy to both a simple http server and the websocket proxy. There
# is probably no need to use envoy here (nginx could suffice), but there are
# probably benefits to always using envoy as our user-facing proxy.

# This is a development-oriented local docker compose file, meant to link together the components of
# the Deephaven Community Core.
#
# There are some simplifying assumptions:
#
# 1. Docker is running locally and has access to filesystem bind mounts
# 2. The images are being built via ./gradlew prepareCompose
# 3. The user is running a non-production system, and does not want to deal with TLS
#
# Please see README.md with more details on how to get started.

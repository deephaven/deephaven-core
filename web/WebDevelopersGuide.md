# Deephaven Servers and Concepts

An installation of Deephaven consists of several servers:
 * One or more Authentication servers, handling authentication and authorization for the other servers.
 * One or more Query Configuration servers, keeping track of persistent queries.
 * One or more Remote Query Dispatcher servers, managing workers as needed.
 * Remote Query Processor (worker) servers, performing queries as requested by persistent queries or client consoles.
 * A Web server, providing the ability for a client to authenticate and gain access to a worker to make queries.
 
Authentication can take many forms, implemented per installation, and from the perspective of the client require a 
username and some secret to connect, such as a SSO token/nonce or a password. Once connected and authenticated, the 
user can request Auth Tokens to connect to another server, or a Reconnection Token to reconnect to the Authentication
server in the event of a disconnect. The Reconnection Token must be periodically refreshed to allow reconnecting without
storing credentials in the client. The Auth Token expires after one minute and can only be used once, so it should only be
requested when the client wants to start a connection to a new server.

The Web server can be connected to by a browser or other websocket client. After connecting, the client must 
authenticate to obtain an Auth Token, and generally should keep that Auth Token up to date. This server will provide 
access to available Query Configs, each detailing the worker on which they are running and the tables available within that 
Query Config. In a later revision of the Deephaven Open API, the Remote Query Dispatcher will also be available, allowing for 
direct console access to the Deephaven system.

From a Query Config, the client will have the details required to initiate another websocket connection to that worker.
There, they must register with their active Auth Token to gain access to the tables on that server. To 
interact with a table, the client should first request the details about the table. With those details, the client may request the 
the contents of the table and subscribe to any updates that occur. 

When it comes to requesting data and updates, tables come in two basic forms: preemptive, and non-preemptive. A 
preemptive table will always send all of its contents to the client, and does not support specific viewport 
subscriptions, while a non-preemptive table will allow the client to specify that they only want to be informed about
updates in a specific set of rows and columns.

Once subscribed, the worker will first send a snapshot of results the client is interested in, and then will send 
periodic updates as needed. If too many changes have taken place in a given timeframe to handle an update, a new 
snapshot may be sent instead. The client can cancel their subscription to a table, and can also request a snapshot of
the table without any update subscription.

The configuration of a Deephaven table is immutable, but new tables can be easily created. Sorting, filtering, or adjusting
the columns of a table are all performed by passing the original table back to the server with one of those operations,
and a new table handle will be sent back informing the client that they can now subscribe to or request data for that 
new table. The new table may or may not share a definition with the previous table - changes such as sorting and 
filtering do not affect the definition. Subscriptions or references can be maintained to intermediate tables, to modify 
sort or filter operations, or to see the previous results alongside the new ones.

# Order of Operations on the Server

Each operation changing what data is visible (sort, filter, setViewport) is understood to be performed
serially - developers can still call other methods, and their work will be queued up but not performed
until the previous operations' changes have been applied.

Additionally, when changing the sort or filter of a table, the current viewport is removed, allowing 
the API consumer to define the correct behavior for their application, either to move to the top of the
new data, or to try to keep the same range of rows visible (as opposed to keeping the same rows visible,
which may now be scattered and have other rows between them, or may not exist at all). 
This means that a new viewport should be applied every time the sort and/or filter
has been changed.

In this example, a new sort is being applied, `rowCount` is the number of visible rows, and 
`visibleColumns` is the list of columns to display:

    // First, change the sort
    table.applySort([nameColumn.sort().desc()]);
    // Then, specify the viewport to be used after the sort is complete
    table.setViewport(0, rowCount, visibleColumns);

In contrast, here we are applying both a sort and a filter at the same time. The viewport should only be set after both the new sort and new filter has been applied because otherwise it would be cleared right away.

    // Change the filter
    table.applyFilter([nameColumn.filter().eqIgnoreCase("FOO").not()]);
    
    // table.setViewport <-- Do not change viewport yet, since we are about to make another change
    
    // Change the sort
    table.applySort([nameColumn.sort().asc()]);
    
    // Finally, apply the viewport now that both changes are made
    table.setViewport(0, rowCount, visibleColumns);
    
Operations performed will be queued on the server to avoid latency.

# Languages

## Javascript

### Overview

In this section, we will give a high-level overview of how
a JavaScript client might interact with a Deephaven installation.

This will be done with pseudocode and simple explanations
to give a complete picture of how the system can be used,
and a brief introduction into Deephaven terminology.

A more technical specification, complete with glossary and important 
implementation details follows.

#### Example 1: Logging In

```
class MyApp {
    constructor() {
        this.client = new Client('https://myserver/dh');

        // the actual token here can be a password, or any other supported auth token
        const credentials = { username: 'bob', token: '$₪£€₽$€₡₪₽€', type: 'password' };

        this.client.onConnected()
            .then(() => this.client.login(credentials))
            .then(() => this.startApp(), console.error);
   }
   startApp() {
     // now that the client is authenticated, all Deephaven functions, 
     // such as opening persistent queries and opening tables, are available
   }
}
new MyApp();
```

In Example 1 above, we are sending the username, the token, and the type of auth to use.
You can configure your own auth handler to integrate with any external system,
and Deephaven will simply check with your server to verify user identities.

The underlying network transport mechanism is not yet available to clients as
we will manage web socket connections and the auth token refreshes automatically;
all the client needs to do is add callbacks to Promises as needed.

#### Example 2: Discovering Database Tables

```
startApp() {
    // Subscribe to updates on all persistent queries
    this.client.addEventListener('queryadded', e => addQuery(e.detail));
    this.client.addEventListener('queryremoved', (e) => removeQuery(e.detail));
    this.client.addEventListener('queryupdated', (e) => updateQuery(e.detail));

    // Fetch all known persistent queries (collections of tables)
    this.client.getKnownConfigs().forEach(queryInfo => addQuery(queryInfo));
}

addQuery(queryInfo) {
    console.log(`Loaded query ${queryInfo.name} [${queryInfo.serial}]`);
    for ( name in queryInfo.tableNames) {
        this.addTable(queryInfo, name);
    }
}
removeQuery(queryInfo) { ... }
updateQuery(queryInfo) { ... }
addTable(queryInfo, name) {
    // Render a list of queries and tables to choose from
}
```

In Example 2 above, we are retrieving and subscribing to changes in Persistent Queries,
which include collections of tables and the configuration for running those tables;
you can read more about Persistent Query settings in the technical specification.

#### Example 3: Selecting a Table

```
addTable(queryInfo, name) {
    // Create an element to click to select table.
    show(new TableSelector(queryInfo, name);
}

class TableSelector {
  constructor(query, name) {
      // Create a function that returns a promise to load the table.
      // Connecting to a table to read information can be expensive, so we avoid doing it.
      this._table = () => queryInfo.table(name);
      this._name = name;
      someElement.innerText = name;
  }

  onClick() {
    this._table().then(table =>
        show(new TableView(this._name, table))
    );
  }
}

class TableView {
    constructor(name, table) {
        this._table = table;
        // Draw a placeholder
        renderFrame(name, table);

        // Subscribe to the updated event to get table data to render
        // addEventListener returns a function to easily perform cleanup
        this._cleanup = table.addEventListener('updated', e => this.renderTable(e));
        // This remote call does not return data directly;
        // instead, we use our subscription to the `updated` event, above.
        table.setViewport(startRow, endRow, table.columns);
    }

    renderFrame(name, table) {
        someHeader.innerText = name;
    }

    renderTable(event) {
        this._viewport = event.detail;
        drawViewport();
    }

    drawViewport() {
        var cnt = this._viewport.offset;
        this._viewport.rows.forEach(row => this.drawRow(cnt++, row));
    }

    drawRow(rowNum, row) {
        // Render a row of data using this._table.columns for type information.
        this._table._columns.forEach(column=> this.drawCell(rowNum, row, column) );
    }

    drawCell(rowNum, row, column) {
        doHtmlThings(rowNum, row.get(column));
    }
    
    dispose() {
        // Stop subscribing to the events from this table
        this._cleanup();
        
        // Additionally, it may make sense to close the Table entirely, if it is not to be used again
        this._table.close();
    }

}
```

In Example 3 above, we are loading the actual table data for rendering;
metadata such as table size, columns, sorts and filters will be kept
up to date for you, but the actual table data will not load until
you call table.setViewport(), and receive `updated` events to trigger drawing.

This allows both the client and the server to decide to trigger a redraw,
without burdening the client with extra state or callback management.

#### Example 4: Sorting and Filtering

```
class TableView {

    // Given a table with columns: type(String), index(Number), created(Date), modified(Date),
    // setSort(columns.type.asc(), columns.created.desc())
    setSort() {
        // all arguments should be dh.Sort objects.
        this._sorts = Array.prototype.slice.apply(arguments);
        var promise = this._table.applySort(this._sorts);
        return promise;
    }

    addSort(sort) {
        this._sorts.push(sort);
        return this._table.applySort(this._sorts);
    }

    // setFilter(
    //       columns.type.eq(FilterValue.ofString('Awesome')), 
    //       columns.modified.greaterThan(FilterValue.ofNumber(yesterday()))
    // )
    setFilter() {
        this._filters = Array.prototype.slice.apply(arguments);
        return this._table.applyFilter(this._filters);
    }

    addFilter(filter) {
        this._filters.push(filter);
        return this._table.applyFilter(this._filters);
    }

    // Use cloning when you want to create a new table to apply sorts and filters without modifying the existing table.
    // Note that each the original and the clone will fire their own events, maintain their own viewport, and
    // individual close() calls will need to be applied individually as appropriate.
    clone(name) {
        if (!name) {
            name = `${this._name}Clone`;
        }
        return this._table.copy()
            .then(newTable=>return new TableView(name, newTable));
    }

}
```

### Web Development Glossary
 * **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises)** - A fluent callback API in 
 modern browsers.
 * **[Web Socket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)** - An outgoing TCP socket connection 
 with a few additional constraints (HTTP CONNECT handshake, XOR of frame contents) that can be created by JS code in 
 modern browsers.
 * **[Web Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers)** - A distinct JS 
 process without access to the DOM, events, or other UI details, allowing for work to be done in the background of 
 modern browsers.

 
### JS API Design
The Deephaven high-level Javascript API is written to handle the details discussed above, and give a web developer a familiar starting
point when writing their application. This section will discuss the abstractions provided to the web developer to avoid
the need to understand the comprehensive workings of the Deephaven platform. 

The connection is established by specifying the URL of the Web server to the `Client` object and logging in. From there, 
Auth Tokens are automatically maintained, and any call that requires connecting to another server will be done 
automatically, including exchange of tokens.

While client tables could still be used as if they were immutable by cloning before making any changes to sort, filter, 
or columns, this API also allows their use as mutable objects, and internally tracks the server-side tables, creating
new ones as is necessary. Additionally, the distinction is not made between table handles and table definitions - the 
JS type `Table` will wrap all of the relevant details.

Total table size is exposed through a method instead of requiring client code to keep track of changes to the size 
across messages.

Format info is not exposed as a distinct, hidden column, but as additional detail on each cell.

Most operations will likely be handled "off-thread" through the use of a web worker to actually handle messages from the
server, and to pass changes back to the server again, so processing sets of changes will not impede the UI from
being responsive. Combined with the async nature of well-behaved JS communicating with the server, most methods that
change the content to be rendered or ask for details not yet rendered will themselves be async, generally through the
use of Promises or events.


###JS API Docs

#### The `dh` namespace
The Deephaven Web API provides similar functionality as the client GUI. The following documentation details the available class types, methods, properties, and events. 
"namespace" here refers to the fact that using any of these objects requires an "dh." prefix.

##### Class `Table`
Provides access to data in a table. Note that several methods present
their response through Promises. This allows the client to both avoid actually connecting to the server until necessary,
and also will permit some changes not to inform the UI right away that they have taken place.

###### Properties
 * `Column[] columns` - Read-only. The columns that are present on this table.  This is always all possible columns.
 If you specify fewer columns in .setViewport(), you will get only those columns in your ViewportData.
 * `Number size` - Read-only. The total count of rows in the table. The size can and will change; see the `sizechanged` 
 event for details. Size will be negative in exceptional cases (eg. the table is uncoalesced, see the `isUncoalesced` property 
 for details). 
 * `Number totalSize` - Read-only. The total count of the rows in the table, excluding any filters. Unlike `size`, 
 changes to this value will not result in any event.
 * `Sort[] sort` - Read-only. An ordered list of Sorts to apply to the table.  To update, call applySort().  Note that
 this getter will return the new value immediately, even though it may take a little time to update on the server.
 You may listen for the `sortchanged` event to know when to update the UI.
 * `FilterCondition[] filter` - Read-only. An ordered list of Filters to apply to the table.  To update, call applyFilter().
 Note that this getter will return the new value immediately, even though it may take a little time to update on the
 server. You may listen for the `filterchanged` event to know when to update the UI.
 * `String[] customColumns` - Read-only. An ordered list of custom column formulas to add to the table, either adding
 new columns or replacing existing ones. To update, call `applyCustomColumns()`.
 * `boolean hasInputTable` - Read-only. True if this table represents a user Input Table (created by InputTable.newInputTable).
 When true, you may call .inputTable() to add or remove data from the underlying table.
 * `TotalsTableConfig totalsTableConfig` - The default configuration to be used when building a `TotalsTable` for this table.
 * `boolean isUncoalesced` - Read-only. True if this table is uncoalesced. Set a viewport or filter on the partition columns 
 to coalesce the table. Check the `isPartitionColumn` property on the table columns to retrieve the partition columns.
 Size will be unavailable until table is coalesced.
 * `boolean isClosed` - Read-only. True if this table has been closed.

###### Methods
 * `applySort(Sort[]):Sort[]` - Replace the currently set sort on this table. Returns the previously set value. Note
 that the sort property will immediately return the new value, but you may receive update events using the old sort
 before the new sort is applied, and the `sortchanged` event fires. Reusing existing, applied sorts may enable
 this to perform better on the server.  The `updated` event will also fire, but `rowadded` and `rowremoved` will not.
 * `applyFilter(FilterCondition[]):FilterCondition[]` - Replace the currently set filters on the table. Returns the previously set value.
 Note that the filter property will immediately return the new value, but you may receive update events using the old
 filter before the new one is applied, and the `filterchanged` event fires. Reusing existing, applied filters may enable
 this to perform better on the server.  The `updated` event will also fire, but `rowadded` and `rowremoved` will not.
 * `applyCustomColumns(String[]):String[]` - Deprecated, use `applyCustomColumns(CustomColumn[])` instead - Replace the current custom columns with a new set. These columns can be
  used when adding new filter and sort operations to the table, as long as they are present.
 * `applyCustomColumns(CustomColumn[]):CustomColumn[]` - Replace the current custom columns with a new set. These columns can be
  used when adding new filter and sort operations to the table, as long as they are present.
 * `setViewport(Number firstRow, Number lastRow, Column[]= columns, Number= updateIntervalMs):TableViewportSubscription` - 
 If the columns parameter is not provided, all columns will be used. If the updateIntervalMs parameter is not provided, 
 a default of one second will be used. Until this is called, no data will be available. Invoking this will result in events
 to be fired once data becomes available, starting with an `updated` event and a `rowadded` event per row in that range.
 The returned object allows the viewport to be closed when no longer needed.
 * `subscribe(Column[] columns, Number= updateIntervalMs):TableSubscription` - Creates a subscription to the specified 
 columns, across all rows in the table. The optional parameter updateIntervalMs may be specified to indicate how often the
 server should send updates, defaulting to one second if omitted. Useful for charts or taking a snapshot of the table 
 atomically. The initial snapshot will arrive in a single event, but later changes will be sent as updates. However, this 
 may still be very expensive to run from a browser for very large tables. Each call to subscribe creates a new subscription,
 which must have `close()` called on it to stop it, and all events are fired from the TableSubscription instance.
 * `getViewportData():Promise<ViewportData>` - Gets the currently visible viewport. If the current set of operations
 has not yet resulted in data, it will not resolve until that data is ready.
 * `copy():Promise<Table>` - Creates a new copy of this table, so it can be sorted and filtered separately, and maintain
 a different viewport.
 * `addEventListener(String type, function listener):Function` - Listen for events on this table.
 Returns a cleanup function.
 * `removeEventListener(String type, function listener)`  - Removes an event listener added to this table.
 * `close()` - Indicates that this Table instance will no longer be used, and its connection to the server can be
 cleaned up.
 * `selectDistinct(Column[]):Promise<Table>` - Returns a new table containing the distinct tuples of values from the
 given columns that are present in the original table. This table can be manipulated as any other table. Sorting is
 often desired as the default sort is the order of appearance of values from the original table.
 * `findColumn(String named):Column` - Retrieve a column by the given name.  You should prefer to always retrieve
 a new Column instance instead of caching a returned value.
 * `findColumns(String[] named):Column[]` - Retrieve multiple columns specified by the given names.
 * `inputTable():Promise<InputTable>` - If .hasInputTable is true, you may call this method to gain access to an
 InputTable object which can be used to mutate the data within the table.  If the table is not an Input Table, the
 promise will be immediately rejected.
 * `getTotalsTable(TotalsTableConfig= config):Promise<TotalsTable>` - Returns a promise that will resolve to a Totals 
 Table of this table. This table will obey the configurations provided as a parameter, or will use the table's default 
 if no parameter is provided, and be updated once per second as necessary. Note that multiple calls to this method will
 each produce a new TotalsTable which must have close() called on it when not in use.
 * `getGrandTotalsTable(TotalsTableConfig= config):Promise<TotalsTable>` - Returns a promise that will resolve to a Totals Table
 of this table, ignoring any filters. See `getTotalsTable()` above for more specifics.
 * `getColumnStatistics(Column column):Promise<ColumnStatistics>` - Returns a promise that will resolve to ColumnStatistics for
 the column of this table.
 * `freeze():Promise<Table>` - Returns a "frozen" version of this table (a server-side snapshot of the entire source 
 table). Viewports on the frozen table will not update. This does not change the original table, and the new table will 
 not have any of the client side sorts/filters/columns. New client side sorts/filters/columns can be added to the frozen 
 copy.
 * `rollup(RollupConfig):Promise<TreeTable>` - Returns a promise that will resolve to a new roll-up `TreeTable` of this table. 
 Multiple calls to this method will each produce a new `TreeTable` which must have close() called on it when not in use.
 * `treeTable(TreeTableConfig):Promise<TreeTable>` - Returns a promise that will resolve to a new `TreeTable` of this table. 
 Multiple calls to this method will each produce a new `TreeTable` which must have close() called on it when not in use. 
 * `join(String joinType, Table rightTable, String[] columnsToMatch, String[]= columnsToAdd):Promise<Table>` - Returns
 a promise that will be resolved with a newly created table holding the results of the join operation. The last
 parameter is optional, and if not specified or empty, all columns from the right table will be added to the output.
 Callers are responsible for ensuring that there are no duplicates - a match pair can be passed instead of a name to
 specify the new name for the column. Supported `joinType` values (consult Deephaven's "Joining Data from Multiple Tables
 for more detail):
   * "Join" <!-- provide a link to https://docs.deephaven.io/latest/Content/writeQueries/tableOperations/joins.htm#Joining_Data_from_Multiple_Tables ? -->
   * "Natural"
   * "AJ"
   * "ReverseAJ"
   * "ExactJoin"
   * "LeftJoin"
 * `partitionBy(String[] keys, boolean= dropKeys):Promise<PartitionedTable>` - Creates a new PartitionedTable from the contents of the
 current table, partitioning data based on the specified keys.
<!--
 * `getAttributes():String[]` - returns an array listing the attributes that are set on this table, minus some of those already
 available via other Table properties. Keys that represent an attribute that can be read in JS can be passed to 
 `getAttribute(key)`.
 * `getAttribute(String key):Any` - returns null if no property exists, a string if it is an easily serializable property,
 or a `Promise<Table>` that will either resolve with a table or error out if the object can't be passed to JS. 
-->
 
###### Static functions
 * `reverse():Sort` - Returns a Sort than can be used to reverse a table. This can be passed into n array in applySort.
 Note that Tree Tables do not support reverse.

###### Events
 * `sizechanged` - The table size has updated, so live scrollbars and the like can be updated accordingly.
 * `updated` - event.detail is the currently visible window, the same as if getViewportData() was called and resolved. 
 Listening to this event removes the need to listen to the finer grained events below for data changes. In contrast, 
 using the finer grained events may enable only updating the specific rows which saw a change.
 * `rowadded` - Finer grained visibility into data being added, rather than just seeing the currently visible viewport.
 Provides the row being added, and the offset it will exist at.
 * `rowremoved` - Finer grained visibility into data being removed, rather than just seeing the currently visible viewport.
 Provides the row being removed, and the offset it used to exist at.
 * `rowupdated` - Finer grained visibility into data being updated, rather than just seeing the currently visible viewport.
 Provides the row being updated and the offset it exists at. 
 * `sortchanged` - Indicates that a sort has occurred, and that the UI should be replaced with the current viewport.
 * `filterchanged` - Indicates that a filter has occurred, and that the UI should be replaced with the current viewport.
 * `customcolumnschanged` - Indicates that columns for this table have changed, and column headers should be updated.
 * `requestfailed` - Indicates that an error occurred on this table on the server or while communicating with it. The 
 message will provide more insight, but recent operations were likely unsuccessful and may need to be reapplied.

##### Class `Column`
Describes the structure of the column, and if desired can be used to get access to the data to be rendered in this
column.

###### Static functions
 * `formatRowColor(String expression): CustomColumn` - Format entire rows colors using the expression specified. Returns a `CustomColumn` object to apply to a table using `applyCustomColumns` with the parameters specified.
 * `createCustomColumn(String name, String expression): CustomColumn` - Return a `CustomColumn` object to apply using `applyCustomColumns` with the expression specified.

###### Methods
 * `get(Row):Any` - Returns the value for this column in the given row. Type will be consistent with the type of the
 Column.
 * `filter():FilterValue` - Creates a new value for use in filters based on this column. Used either as a parameter to
 another filter operation, or as a builder to create a filter operation.
 * `formatColor(String expression): CustomColumn` - Return a `CustomColumn` object to apply using `applyCustomColumns` with the expression specified.
 * `formatNumber(String expression): CustomColumn` - Return a `CustomColumn` object to apply using `applyCustomColumns` with the expression specified.
 * `formatDate(String expression): CustomColumn` - Return a `CustomColumn` object to apply using `applyCustomColumns` with the expression specified.
 * `sort():Sort` - Creates a sort builder object, to be used when sorting by this column.

###### Properties
 * `Number index` - Deprecated, do not use. Internal index of the column in the table, to be used as a key on the Row.
 * `String type` - Type of the row data that can be found in this column.
 * `String name` - Label for this column.
 * `boolean isPartitionColumn` - True if this column is a partition column. Partition columns are used for filtering
 uncoalesced tables (see `isUncoalesced` property on `Table`) 
 * `String constituentType` - If this column is part of a roll-up tree table, represents the type of the row data that 
   can be found in this column for leaf nodes if includeConstituents is enabled. Otherwise, it is `null`.

##### Class `Sort`
Describes a Sort present on the table. No visible constructor, created through the use of Column.sort(), will be tied to
that particular column data. Sort instances are immutable, and use a builder pattern to make modifications. All methods
return a new Sort instance. 

###### Methods
 * `asc():Sort` - Builds a Sort instance to sort values in ascending order.
 * `desc():Sort` - Builds a Sort instance to sort values in descending order.
 * `abs():Sort` - Builds a Sort instance which takes the absolute value before applying order.

###### Properties
 * `Column column` - The column which is sorted.
 * `String direction` - The direction of this sort, either `ASC`, `DESC`, or `REVERSE`.
 * `boolean isAbs` - True if the absolute value of the column should be used when sorting; defaults to false. 

##### Class `CustomColumn`
* `String name` - The name of the column to use.
* `String type` - Type of custom column. One of `FORMAT_COLOR`, `FORMAT_NUMBER`, `FORMAT_DATE`, or `NEW`.
* `String expression` - The expression to evaluate this custom column.

##### Class `FilterValue`
Describes data that can be filtered, either a column reference or a literal value. Used this way, the type of a value
can be specified so that values which are ambiguous or not well supported in JS will not be confused with Strings or imprecise numbers (e.g., nanosecond-precision date values). Additionally, once wrapped in this way, methods can be
called on these value literal instances. These instances are immutable - any method called on them returns a new
instance.

###### Static factory methods
 * `ofString(?):FilterValue` - Constructs a string for the filter API from the given parameter.
 * `ofNumber(?):FilterValue` - Constructs a number for the filter API from the given parameter. Can also be used on the 
 values returned from `Row.get` for DateTime values. To create a filter with a date, use `dh.DateWrapper.ofJsDate` or
 `dh.i18n.DateTimeFormat.parse`. To create a filter with a 64-bit long integer, use `dh.LongWrapper.ofString`.
 * `ofBoolean(?):FilterValue` - Constructs a boolean for the filter API from the given parameter.

 given set of values.
 * `notInIgnoreCase(FilterValue[]):FilterCondition` - Returns a filter condition checking that the current value is not 
 in the given set of values, ignoring differences of upper vs lower case.
 * `contains(FilterValue):FilterCondition` - Returns a filter condition checking if the given value contains the given
 string value.
 * `containsIgnoreCase(FilterValue):FilterCondition` - Returns a filter condition checking if the given value contains
 the given string value, ignoring differences of upper vs lower case.
 * `matches(FilterValue):FilterCondition` - Returns a filter condition checking if the given value matches the provided
 regular expressions string. Regex patterns use Java regex syntax.
 * `matchesIgnoreCase(FilterValue):FilterCondition` - Returns a filter condition checking if the given value matches 
 the provided regular expressions string, ignoring differences of upper vs lower case. Regex patterns use Java regex
 syntax.
 * `isTrue():FilterCondition` - Returns a filter condition checking if the current value is a true boolean.
 * `isFalse():FilterCondition` - Returns a filter condition checking if the current value is a false boolean.
 * `isNull():FilterCondition` - Returns a filter condition checking if the current value is a null value.
 * `invoke(String, ...?):FilterCondition` - Returns a filter condition invoking the given method on the current value, 
 with the given parameters. Currently supported functions that can be invoked on a String:
  
     * `startsWith` - Returns true if the current string value starts with the supplied string argument.
     * `endsWith` - Returns true if the current string value ends with the supplied string argument.
     * `matches` - Returns true if the current string value matches the supplied string argument used as a Java regular 
     expression.
     * `contains` - Returns true if the current string value contains the supplied string argument. When invoking against
     a constant, this should be avoided in favor of FilterValue.contains.
 
##### Class `FilterCondition`
Describes a filter which can be applied to a table. Replacing these instances may be more expensive than reusing them.
These instances are immutable - all operations that compose them to build bigger expressions return a new instance.

###### Methods
 * `not():FilterCondition` - Returns the opposite of this condition.
 * `and(...FilterCondition):FilterCondition` - Returns a condition representing the current condition logically ANDed
 with the other parameters.
 * `or(...FilterCondition):FilterCondition` - Returns a condition representing the current condition logically ORed with
 the other parameters.
 * `toString():String` - Returns a string suitable for debugging showing the details of this condition.

<!--
###### Properties
 * `Column[] columns` - The columns tested in some way by this filter (not yet supported).
 -->
 
###### Static functions
 * `search(FilterValue, FilterValue[]=):FilterCondition` - Returns a filter condition which will check if the given
 value can be found in any supported column on whatever table this FilterCondition is passed to. This FilterCondition is
 somewhat unique in that it need not be given a column instance, but will adapt to any table. On numeric columns, with a
 value passed in which can be parsed as a number, the column will be filtered to numbers which equal, or can be
 "rounded" effectively to this number. On String columns, the given value will match any column which contains this
 string in a case-insensitive search. An optional second argument can be passed, an array of `FilterValue` from the 
 columns to limit this search to (see `Column.filter()`).
 * `invoke(String, ...FilterValue):FilterCondition` - Returns a filter condition invoking a static function with the 
 given parameters. Currently supported Deephaven static functions:
     * `inRange` - Given three comparable values, returns true if the first is less than the second but greater than the 
     third.
     * `isInf` - Returns true if the given number is "infinity".
     * `isNaN` - Returns true if the given number is "not a number".
     * `isFinite` - Returns true if the given number is not null, is not infinity, and is not "not a number".
     * `startsWith` - Returns true if the first string starts with the second string.
     * `endsWith` - Returns true if the first string ends with the second string.
     * `matches` - Returns true if the first string argument matches the second string used as a Java regular expression.
     * `contains` - Returns true if the first string argument contains the second string as a substring.
     * `in` - Returns true if the first string argument can be found in the second array argument. Note that the array
     can only be specified as a column reference at this time - typically the `FilterValue.in` method should be used in
     other cases.


##### Class `ViewportData`
Contains data in the current viewport. Also contains the offset to this data, so that the actual row number may be
determined. Do not assume that the first row in `rows` is the first visible row, because extra rows may be provided for easier
scrolling without going to the server.

##### Properties
 * `Number offset` - The index of the first returned row.
 * `Row[] rows` - An array of rows of data.
 * `Column[] columns` - A list of columns describing the data types in each row.

##### Class `Row`
This object may be pooled internally or discarded and not updated. Do not retain references to it. Instead, request the 
viewport again.

###### Methods
 * `get(Column column):Any` - Returns the data for the given column's cell.
 * `getFormat(Column column):Format` - Returns the format object for the given columns' cell.
 
##### Class `Format`
This object may be pooled internally or discarded and not updated. Do not retain references to it.

###### Properties 
 * `String color` - Color to apply to the text, in `#rrggbb` format.
 * `String backgroundColor` - Color to apply to the cell's background, in `#rrggbb` format.
 * `String formatString` - The format string to apply to the value of this cell (see https://docs.deephaven.io/latest/Content/writeQueries/formatTables.htm#Formatting_Tables).
 * `String numberFormat` - DEPRECATED - use `formatString` instead. Number format string to apply to the value in this cell (see https://docs.deephaven.io/latest/Content/writeQueries/formatTables.htm#Formatting_Tables).

##### Class `PartitionedTable`
Represents a set of Tables each corresponding to some key. The keys are available locally, but a call must be made to 
the server to get each Table. All tables will have the same structure.

###### Methods
 * `getKeys():String[]` - The set of all currently known keys. This is kept up to date, so getting the list after adding
 an event listener for `keyadded` will ensure no keys are missed.
 * `size():Number` - The count of known keys.
 * `close()` - Indicates that this PartitionedTable will no longer be used, removing subcriptions to updated keys, etc. This
 will not affect tables in use.
 * `getTable(String):Promise<Table>` - Fetches the table with the given key.

###### Events
 * `keyadded` - Indicates that a new key has been added to the array of keys, which can now be fetched with getTable.
 * `requestfailed` - Indicates that an error has occurred while communicating with the server.

##### Class `InputTable`
Represents a User Input Table, which can have data added to it from other sources.

You may add rows using dictionaries of key-value tuples (representing columns by name), add tables containing all the key/value 
columns to add, or delete tables containing the keys to delete. Each operation is atomic, and will either succeed completely 
or fail completely. To guarantee order of operations, apply an operation and wait for the response before sending the next operation.

Each table has one or more key columns, where each unique combination of keys will appear at most once in the table.

To view the results of the Input Table, you should use standard table operations on the InputTable's source Table object.

###### Properties
 * `String[] keys` - A list of the key columns, by name.
 * `Column[] keyColumns` - A list of the key Column objects.
 * `String[] values` - A list of the value columns, by name.
 * `Column[] valueColumns` - A list of the value Column objects.
 * `Table table` - The source table for this Input Table.

###### Methods
 * `addRow(Object from):Promise<InputTable>` - Adds a single row to the table. For each key or value column name in the
  Input Table, we retrieve that javascript property at that name and validate it can be put into the given column type.
 * `addRows(Object[] from):Promise<InputTable>` - Add multiple rows to a table. 
 * `addTable(Table from):Promise<InputTable>` - Add an entire table to this Input Table.  Only column names that match
 the definition of the input table will be copied, and all key columns must have values filled in.  This only copies
 the current state of the source table; future updates to the source table will not be reflected in the Input Table.
 The returned promise will be resolved to the same InputTable instance this method was called upon once the server returns.
 * `addTables(Table[] from):Promise<InputTable>` - Add multiple tables to this Input Table.
 * `deleteTable(Table from):Promise<InputTable>` - Deletes an entire table from this Input Table. Key columns must match
 the Input Table.
 * `deleteTables(Table[] from):Promise<InputTable>` - Delete multiple tables from this Input Table.

##### Class `TotalsTable`
A simplistic Table, providing access to aggregation of the table it is sourced from. This table is always automatically subscribed to its parent, and adopts changes automatically from it. 
This class has limited methods found on Table. Instances of this type always have a size of one when no groupBy is set on the config, but may potentially contain as
few as zero rows, or as many as the parent table if each row gets its own group.

When using the `groupBy` feature, it may be desireable to also provide a row to the user with all values across all
rows. To achieve this, request the same Totals Table again, but remove the `groupBy` setting.

###### Properties
 * `TotalsTableConfig totalsTableConfig` - Read-only. The configuration used when creating this Totals Table. 
 * `Column[] columns` - Read-only. The columns present on this table. Note that this may not include all columns in the parent
 table, and in cases where a given column has more than one aggregation applied, the column name will have a suffix
 indicating the aggregation used. This suffixed name will be of the form `columnName + '__' + aggregationName`.
 * `Number size` - Read-only. The total number of rows in this table. This may change as the base table's configuration,
 filter, or contents change.
 * `Sort[] sort` - Read-only. An ordered list of Sorts to apply to the table.  To update, call applySort().  Note that
 this getter will return the new value immediately, even though it may take a little time to update on the server.
 You may listen for the `sortchanged` event to know when to update the UI.
 * `FilterCondition[] filter` - Read-only. An ordered list of Filters to apply to the table.  To update, call applyFilter().
 Note that this getter will return the new value immediately, even though it may take a little time to update on the
 server. You may listen for the `filterchanged` event to know when to update the UI.
 * `CustomColumn[] customColumns` - Read-only. An ordered list of custom column formulas to add to the table, either adding
 new columns or replacing existing ones. To update, call `applyCustomColumns()`.

###### Methods
 * `getViewportData():Promise<ViewportData>` - Gets the currently visible viewport. If the current set of operations
 has not yet resulted in data, it will not resolve until that data is ready.
 * `setViewport(Number firstRow, Number lastRow, Column[]= columns)` - Specifies the range of items to pass to the 
 client and update as they change. If the columns parameter is not provided, all columns will be used. Until this is 
 called, no data will be available. Invoking this will result in events to be fired once data becomes available, 
 starting with an `updated` event and one `rowadded` event per row in that range.
 * `findColumn(String named):Column` - Retrieve a column by the given name.  You should prefer to always retrieve
 a new Column instance instead of caching a returned value.
 * `findColumns(String[] named):Column[]` - Retrieve multiple columns specified by the given names.
 * `close()` - Indicates that the table will no longer be used, and resources used to provide it can be freed up on the
 server.
 * `applySort(Sort[]):Sort[]` - Replace the currently set sort on this table. Returns the previously set value. Note
 that the sort property will immediately return the new value, but you may receive update events using the old sort
 before the new sort is applied, and the `sortchanged` event fires. Reusing existing, applied sorts may enable
 this to perform better on the server.  The `updated` event will also fire, but `rowadded` and `rowremoved` will not.
 * `applyFilter(FilterCondition[]):FilterCondition[]` - Replace the currently set filters on the table. Returns the previously set value.
 Note that the filter property will immediately return the new value, but you may receive update events using the old
 filter before the new one is applied, and the `filterchanged` event fires. Reusing existing, applied filters may enable
 this to perform better on the server.  The `updated` event will also fire, but `rowadded` and `rowremoved` will not.
 * `applyCustomColumns(String[]):String[]` - Deprecated, use `applyCustomColumns(CustomColumn[])` instead - Replace the current custom columns with a new set. These columns can be
 used when adding new filter and sort operations to the table, as long as they are present.
 * `applyCustomColumns(CustomColumn[]):CustomColumn[]` - Replace the current custom columns with a new set. These columns can be
    used when adding new filter and sort operations to the table, as long as they are present.
 * `addEventListener(String type, function listener):Function` - Listen for events on the main connection.  Returns a
 convenience function to remove the event listener.
 * `removeEventListener(String type, function listener)` - Allow for manual "normal" event handler removal as well.
 
###### Events
All events that can fire on a Table can also fire from a TotalsTable, and can be interacted with in the same way.

##### Class `TreeTable`
Similar to a table, a Tree Table provides access to subscribed viewport data on the current hierarchy. A different Row type is used
within that viewport, showing the depth of that node within the tree and indicating details about whether or not it
has children or is expanded. The Tree Table itself then provides the ability to change if a row is expanded or not.
Methods used to control or check if a row should be expanded or not can be invoked on a TreeRow instance, or on the
number of the row (thus allowing for expanding/collapsing rows which are not currently visible in the viewport).

Events and viewports are somewhat different than tables, due to the expense of computing the expanded/collapsed rows
and count of children at each level of the hierarchy, and differences in the data that is available.

 * There is no `totalSize` property.
 * The viewport is not un-set when changes are made to filter or sort, but changes will continue to be streamed in. It 
 is suggested that the viewport be changed to the desired position (usually the first N rows) after any filter/sort
 change is made. Likewise, `getViewportData()` will always return the most recent data, and will not wait if
 a new operation is pending.
 * Custom columns are not directly supported. If the `TreeTable` was created client-side, the original Table can have
 custom columns applied, and the `TreeTable` can be recreated.
 * The `totalsTableConfig` property is instead a method, and returns a promise so the config can be fetched 
 asynchronously.
 * Totals Tables for trees vary in behavior between hierarchical tables and roll-up tables. This behavior is based on
 the original flat table used to produce the Tree Table - for a hierarchical table (i.e. Table.treeTable in the query
 config), the totals will include non-leaf nodes (since they are themselves actual rows in the table), but in a roll-up
 table, the totals only include leaf nodes (as non-leaf nodes are generated through grouping the contents of the 
 original table). Roll-ups also have the `isIncludeConstituents` property, indicating that a `Column` in the tree may 
 have a `constituentType` property reflecting that the type of cells where `hasChildren` is false will be different from 
 usual.

###### Properties
 * `Number size` - The current number of rows given the table's contents and the various expand/collapse states of each
 node. (No totalSize is provided at this time; its definition becomes unclear between roll-up and tree tables, especially
 when considering collapse/expand states).
 * `Sort[] sort` - The current sort configuration of this Tree Table.
 * `FilterCondition[] filter` - The current filter configuration of this Tree Table.
 * `Column[] columns` - The columns that can be shown in this Tree Table.
 * `boolean isIncludeConstituents` - True if this is a roll-up and will provide the original rows that make up each grouping.

###### Methods
 * `expand(Number|TreeRow, boolean expandDescendants = false)` - Expands the given node, so that its children are visible when they are in the viewport. 
 The parameter can be the row index, or the row object itself. The second parameter is a boolean value, false by default, specifying if the row and all descendants should be fully expanded. Equivalent to `setExpanded(row, true)` with an optional third boolean parameter. 
 * `collapse(Number|TreeRow)` - Collapses the given node, so that its children and descendants are not visible in the
 size or the viewport. The parameter can be the row index, or the row object itself. Equivalent to 
 `setExpanded(row, false, false)`.
 * `setExpanded(Number|TreeRow, boolean, boolean)` - Specifies if the given node should be expanded or collapsed. If this node has
 children, and the value is changed, the size of the table will change. If node is to be expanded and the third parameter, `expandDescendants`, is true, then its children will also be expanded.
 * `isExpanded(Number|TreeRow):boolean` - Returns true if the given row is expanded, false otherwise. Equivalent to
 `TreeRow.isExpanded`, if an instance of the row is available.
 * `setViewport(Number firstRow, Number lastRow, Column[]= columns)`
 * `getViewportData():Promise<ViewportData>` -
 * `close()` - Indicates that the table will no longer be used, and server resources can be freed.
 * `applySort(Sort[]):Sort[]` - Applies the given sort to all levels of the tree. Returns the previous sort in use.
 * `applyFilter(FilterCondition[]):FilterCondition[]` - Applies the given filter to the contents of the tree in
 such a way that if any node is visible, then any parent node will be visible as well even if that parent node would not
 normally be visible due to the filter's condition. Returns the previous sort in use.
 * `findColumn(String):Column` - Returns a column with the given name, or throws an exception if it cannot be found.
 * `findColumns(String[]):Column[]` - Returns an array with all of the named columns in order, or throws an exception
 if one cannot be found.
 * `getTotalsTableConfig():Promise<TotalsTableConfig>` - Fetches the Totals config for the table that this Tree Table
 was based on, so that the content of the flat table can be aggregated. 
 * `getTotalsTable(TotalsTableConfig):Promise<TotalsTable>` - Constructs a new Totals Table from the given config, based
 on the current filter status of this Tree Table. If null or not provided, the default config (see 
 `getTotalsTableConfig()`) will be used.
 * `getGrandTotalsTable(TotalsTableConfig):Promise<TotalsTable>` - Constructs a new Totals Table from the given config,
 ignoring any filters set on this Tree Table. If null or not provided, the default config (see `getTotalsTableConfig()`)
 will be used.
 * `addEventListener(String type, function listener):Function` - Listen for events on this Tree Table.
 Returns a cleanup function.
 * `removeEventListener(String type, function listener)` - Removes an event listener from this Tree Table.
 * `copy():Promise<TreeTable>` - Creates a new copy of this treetable, so it can be sorted and filtered separately, and
 maintain a different viewport. Unlike Table, this will _not_ copy the filter or sort, since tree table viewport
 semantics differ, and without a viewport set, the treetable doesn't evaluate these settings, and they aren't readable
 on the properties. Expanded state is also not copied.

###### Events
 * `updated` - event.detail is the currently visible viewport data based on the active viewport configuration.

##### Class `TreeRow` extends `Row`
Like `Row`, `TreeRow` represents visible rows in the table, but with additional properties to reflect the tree structure.

###### Properties
 * `boolean isExpanded` - True if this node is currently expanded to show its children; false otherwise. Those children
 will be the rows below this one with a greater depth than this one.
 * `boolean hasChildren` - True if this node has children and can be expanded; false otherwise. Note that this value may
 change when the table updates, depending on the table's configuration.
 * `Number depth` - The number of levels above this node; zero for top level nodes. Generally used by the UI to indent
 the row and its expand/collapse icon.
 
##### Class `TableViewportSubscription`
This object serves as a "handle" to a subscription, allowing it to be acted on directly or canceled outright. If you retain
an instance of this, you have two choices - either only use it to call `close()` on it to stop the table's viewport without
creating a new one, or listen directly to this object instead of the table for data events, and always call `close()` when
finished. Calling any method on this object other than close() will result in it continuing to live on after `setViewport`
is called on the original table, or after the table is modified.

###### Methods
 * `close()` - Stops this viewport from running, stopping all events on itself and on the table that created it.
 * `setViewport(Number firstRow, Number lastRow, Column[]= columns)` - Changes the rows and columns set on this viewport.
 This cannot be used to change the update interval.
 * `getViewportData():Promise<ViewportData>` - Gets the data currently visible in this viewport.
 * `addEventListener(String type, function listener):Function` - Listens for events on this viewport subscription.
 Returns a cleanup function.
 * `removeEventListener(String type, function listener)` - Removes an event listener on this viewport subscription. 

##### Class `TableSubscription`
Represents a subscription to the table on the server. Changes made to the table will not be reflected here - the subscription
must be closed and a new one optioned to see those changes. The event model is slightly different from viewports to make it 
less expensive to compute for large tables.

###### Properties
 * `Column[] columns` - The columns that were subscribed to when this subscription was created.
 
###### Methods
 * `close()` - Stops the subscription on the server.
 * `addEventListener(String type, function listener):Function` - Listens for events on this table subscription.
 Returns a cleanup function.
 * `removeEventListener(String type, function listener)` - Removes an event listener on this table subscription.
 
###### Events
 * `updated` - Indicates that some new data is available on the client, either an initial snapshot or a delta update.
 The `detail` field of the event will contain a TableSubscriptionEventData detailing what has changed, or allowing access
 to the entire range of items currently in the subscribed columns.

##### Class `TableSubscriptionEventData`
This class supports two ways of reading the table - checking the changes made since the last update, and reading all
data currently in the table. While it is more expensive to always iterate over every single row in the table,
it may in some cases actually be cheaper than maintaining state separately and updating only the changes, though both
options should be considered.

The RangeSet objects allow iterating over the LongWrapper indexes in the table. Note that these "indexes" are not necessarily 
contiguous and may be negative, and represent some internal state on the server, allowing it to keep track of data efficiently.
Those LongWrapper objects can be passed to the various methods on this instance to read specific rows or cells out of the table.

###### Properties
 * `Row[] rows` - A lazily computed array of all rows in the entire table. 
 * `RangeSet added` - The ordered set of row indexes added since the last update.
 * `RangeSet removed` - The ordered set of row indexes removed since the last update.
 * `RangeSet updated` - The ordered set of row indexes updated since the last update.

###### Methods
 * `get(LongWrapper index):Row` - Reads a row object from the table, from which any subscribed column can be read.
 * `getData(LongWrapper index, Column column):Object` - Reads a specific cell from the table, from the specified row and
 column.
 * `getFormat(LongWrapper index, Column column):Format` - Reads the Format to use for a cell from the specified row and
 column.
 
##### Class `RangeSet`
This class allows iteration over non-contiguous indexes. In the future, this will support the EcmaScript 2015 Iteration
protocol, but for now has one method which returns an iterator, and also supports querying the size. Additionally,
we may add support for creating RangeSet objects to better serve some use cases.

###### Properties
 * `Number size` - The total count of items contained in this collection. In some cases this can be expensive to compute,
 and generally should not be needed except for debugging purposes, or preallocating space (i.e., do not call this property
 each time through a loop).
 
###### Methods
 * `iterator():Iterator<LongWrapper>` - Returns a new iterator over all indexes in this collection. 
 
##### Protocol `Iterator<T>`
This is part of EcmaScript 2015, documented here for completeness. It supports a single method, `next()`, which returns
an object with a `boolean` named `done` (true if there are no more items to return; false otherwise), and optionally
some `T` instance, `value`, if there was at least one remaining item.

##### Class `ColumnStatistics`
This class holds the results of a call to generate statistics on a table column.

###### Methods
 * `getType(String name):String` - Gets the format type for a statistic. A null return value means that the column formatting should be used.

###### Properties
 * `Map<String, Double> statisticsMap` - A map of each statistic's name to its value.
 * `Map<String, Double> uniqueValues` - A map of each unique value's name to the count of how many times it occurred in the column.  This map will be empty for tables containing more than 19 unique values.

##### Class `TotalsTableConfig`
Describes how a Totals Table will be generated from its parent table. Each table has a default (which may be null)
indicating how that table was configured when it was declared, and each Totals Table has a similar property describing
how it was created. Both the `Table.getTotalsTable` and `Table.getGrandTotalsTable` methods take this config as an
optional parameter - without it, the table's default will be used, or if null, a default instance of `TotalsTableConfig`
will be supplied.

This class has a no-arg constructor, allowing an instance to be made with the default values provided. However, any JS
object can be passed in to the methods which accept instances of this type, provided their values adhere to the expected
formats.

###### Properties
 * `boolean showTotalsByDefault` - Specifies if a Totals Table should be expanded by default in the UI. Defaults to 
 false.
 * `boolean showGrandTotalsByDefault` - Specifies if a Grand Totals Table should be expanded by default in the UI. 
 Defaults to false.
 * `String defaultOperation` - Specifies the default operation for columns that do not have a specific operation applied; defaults to "Sum".
 * `Object.<String[]> operationMap` - Mapping from each column name to the aggregation(s) that should be applied to that 
 column in the resulting Totals Table. If a column is omitted, the defaultOperation is used.
 * `String[] groupBy` - Groupings to use when generating the Totals Table. One row will exist for each unique set of
 values observed in these columns. See also `Table.selectDistinct`.
 
##### Class `RollupConfig`
Describes a grouping and aggregations for a roll-up table. Pass to the `Table.rollup` function to create a roll-up table.

###### Properties
 * `String[] groupingColumns` - Ordered list of columns to group by to form the hierarchy of the resulting roll-up table.
 * `Object.<String[]> aggregations` - Mapping from each aggregation name to the ordered list of columns it should be 
   applied to in the resulting roll-up table.
 * `boolean includeConstituents` - Optional parameter indicating if an extra leaf node should be added at the bottom of 
 the hierarchy, showing the rows in the underlying table which make up that grouping. Since these values might be a different
 type from the rest of the column, any client code must check if TreeRow.hasChildren = false, and if so, interpret those
 values as if they were Column.constituentType instead of Column.type. Defaults to false.
 * `boolean includeDescriptions` - Optional parameter indicating if original column descriptions should be included. Defaults to true.

##### Class `RollupTableConfig (deprecated)`
`RollupTableConfig` has been deprecated. Use `RollupConfig` instead.
 
##### Class `TreeTableConfig`
Like TotalsTableConfig, `TreeTableConfig` supports an operation map indicating how to aggregate the data, as well as an array of column names
which will be the layers in the roll-up tree, grouped at each level. An additional optional value can be provided
describing the strategy the engine should use when grouping the rows.

###### Properties
 * `String idColumn` - The column representing the unique ID for each item 
 * `String parentColumn` - The column representing the parent ID for each item
 * `String strategy` - Optional parameter indicating how the grouping should be performed in the engine. See `ByStrategy` enum for permitted values.
  If not set, `DEFAULT` will be used.
 * `boolean promoteOrphansToRoot` - Optional parameter indicating if items with an invalid parent ID should be promoted to root. Defaults to false.

##### Enum `ByStrategy`
The strategy for how a roll-up should be performed in the engine.
 * `DEFAULT` - Allow the query engine to heuristically determine what should be done
 * `LINEAR` - Read the key group by columns linearly, adding each key to the aggregation state factory one at a time
 * `LINEAR_GROUPS` - Read the key group by columns linearly, but create groups and add all indices to the state factory together
 * `USE_EXISTING_GROUPS` - If there is a group, use it; otherwise operate as LINEAR_GROUPS

#### The `dh.plot` namespace:

##### Class `Figure`
Provides the details for a figure.

The Deephaven JS API supports automatic lossless downsampling of time-series data, when that data is plotted in one or
more line series. Using a scatter plot or a X-axis of some type other than DateTime will prevent this feature
from being applied to a series. To enable this feature, invoke `Axis.range(...)` to specify the length in pixels of the
axis on the screen, and the range of values that are visible, and the server will use that width (and range, if any) to
reduce the number of points sent to the client.

Downsampling can also be controlled when calling either `Figure.subscribe()` or `Series.subscribe()` - both can be given
an optional `dh.plot.DownsampleOptions` argument. Presently only two valid values exist, `DEFAULT`, and `DISABLE`, 
and if no argument is specified, `DEFAULT` is assumed. If there are more than 30,000 rows in a table, downsampling will
be encouraged - data will not load without calling `subscribe(DISABLE)` or enabling downsampling via `Axis.range(...)`.
If there are more than 200,000 rows, data will refuse to load without downsampling and `subscribe(DISABLE)` would have
no effect.

Downsampled data looks like normal data, except that select items have been removed if they would be redundant in the UI
given the current configuration. Individual rows are intact, so that a tooltip or some other UI item is sure to be 
accurate and consistent, and at least the highest and lowest value for each axis will be retained as well, to ensure that
the "important" values are visible.

Four events exist to help with interacting with downsampled data, all fired from the `Figure` instance itself. First,
`downsampleneeded` indicates that more than 30,000 rows would be fetched, and so specifying downsampling is no longer
optional - it must either be enabled (calling `axis.range(...)`), or disabled. If the figure is configured for downsampling,
when a change takes place that requires that the server perform some downsampling work, the `downsamplestarted` event
will first be fired, which can be used to present a brief loading message, indicating to the user why data is not ready
yet - when the server side process is complete, `downsamplefinished` will be fired. These events will repeat when the
range changes, such as when zooming, panning, or resizing the figure. Finally, `downsamplefailed` indicates that something
when wrong when downsampling, or possibly that downsampling cannot be disabled due to the number of rows in the table.

 `Axis.range()` or subscribe(). The `event.detail` value is an array of `Series` instances which are affected by this.
 * `downsamplefinished` - Downsampling has finished on the given `Series` instances, and data will arrive shortly. The
 `event.detail` value is the array of `Series` instances.

 properties, the `message` string describing what went wrong, the `size` number showing the full size of the table, and 
 the `series` property, an array of `Series` instances affected.
 * `downsampleneeded` - There are too many points to be drawn in the table which backs these series, and downsampling should
 be enabled. As an alternative, downsampling can be explicitly disabled, provided there are less than 200,000 rows in 
 the table.

 * `OHLC` - Similar to an XY plot, except that this will be TIME instead of X, and OPEN/HIGH/LOW/CLOSE instead of Y.
 * `CATEGORY` - Similar to a XY chart, except one of the axis will be based on a category instead of being numeric.
 * `XYZ` - Similar to XY, this chart will have three numeric dimensions, plotting each with an X, Y, and Z value.
 * `CATEGORY_3D` - Similar to a CATEGORY chart, this will have two category axes, and one numeric axis.
 
##### Enum `AxisFormatType`
 * `CATEGORY` - Indicates that this axis will have discrete values rather than be on a continuous numeric axis.
 * `NUMBER` - Indicates that the values are numeric, and should be plotted on a continuous axis.
 
##### Enum `AxisPosition`
 * `TOP` - The axis should be drawn at the top of the chart.
 * `BOTTOM` - The axis should be drawn at the bottom of the chart.
 * `LEFT` - The axis should be drawn at the left side of the chart.
 * `RIGHT` - The axis should be drawn at the right side of the chart.
 * `NONE` - No position makes sense for this axis, or the position is apparent from the axis type.
 
##### Enum `AxisType`
 * `X` - Indicates that this is an X-axis, typically drawn on the bottom or top of the chart, depending on position attribute
 * `Y` - Indicates that this is a Y-Axis, typically drawn on the left or right of the chart, depending on position attribute
 * `Z` - Indicates that this is a Z-Axis, typically used as a "third" axis on a projection that makes it appear to be set at
 a right angle to both X and Y.

 series should have its items drawn on top of the previous one.
 * `LINE` - Series items will be drawn as points connected by a line, with two NUMBER axes.
 * `AREA` - Series items will be drawn as points connected by a line with a filled area under the line.

 and TIME on the other axis.
 * `SCATTER` - Series items will be individually drawn as points, one two or three NUMBER axes
 <!-- not for MVP * `STEP` - like LINE, except the connecting lines are only parallel to the two axes - after each point a horizontal line is
 drawn until the line is directly below the subsequent point, then a vertical line is drawn up to that point. -->
 * `ERROR_BAR` - Series items with 6 data sources, three on X and three on Y, to represent the low/mid/high of each item.
 
##### SourceType
This enum describes the source it is in, and how this aspect of the data in the series should be used to render the item.
For example, a point in a error-bar plot might have a X value, three Y values (Y, Y_LOW, Y_HIGH), and some COLOR per item - 
the three SeriesDataSources all would share the same Axis instance, but would have different SourceType enums set. The
exact meaning of each source type will depend on the series that they are in. 
 * `X` - LINE, AREA, STACKED_LINE, STACKED_AREA, ERROR_BAR, HISTOGRAM, SCATTER, STEP. Also used in PIE, but only to 
 identify the correct axis.

#### The `dh.i18n` namespace:
 
##### Class `NumberFormat`
Utility class to parse and format numbers, using the same format patterns as are supported by the standard Java
implementation used in the Deephaven server and swing client.

###### Constructor
 * `new dh.i18n.NumberFormat(pattern)` - Creates a new number format instance. This generally should be avoided in favor
 of the static `getFormat` function, which will create and cache an instance so that later calls share the same
 instance.
  
###### Methods
 * `parse(String text):Number` - Parses the given text using this instance's pattern into a JS Number.
 * `format(Object number):String` - Formats the specified number (or Java `long` value) using this instance's pattern.

###### Static functions
 * `getFormat(String pattern):NumberFormat` - Returns a number format instance matching the specified format. If this
 format has not been specified before, a new instance will be created and stored for later reuse.
 * `parse(String pattern, String text):Number` - Parses the given text using the cached format matching the given
 pattern.
 * `format(String pattern, Object number):String` - Formats the specified number (or Java `long` value) using the 
 cached format matching the given pattern string.

##### Class `DateTimeFormat`
Utility class to parse and format various date/time values, using the same format patterns as are supported by the 
standard Java implementation used in the Deephaven server and swing client.

As Deephaven internally uses nanosecond precision to record dates, this API expects nanoseconds in most use cases, with
the one exception of the JS `Date` type, which is not capable of more precision than milliseconds. Note, however, that
when passing nanoseconds as a JS `Number` there is likely to be some loss of precision, though this is still supported
for easier interoperability with other JS code. The values returned by `parse()` will be an opaque object wrapping
the full precision of the specified date, However, this object supports `toString()` and `valueOf()` to return a string
representation of that value, as well as a `asNumber()` to return a JS `Number` value and a `asDate()` to return a JS
`Date` value. 

Caveats: 
 * The `D` format (for "day of year") is not supported by this implementation at this time.
 * The `%t` format for short timezone code is not supported by this implementation at this time, though `z` will work
 as expected in the browser to emit the user's own timezone. 

###### Constructor
 * `new dh.i18n.DateTimeFormat(String pattern)` - Creates a new date/time format instance. This generally should be avoided in favor
 of the static `getFormat` function, which will create and cache an instance so that later calls share the same
 instance.

###### Methods
 * `format(Object date, TimeZone tz):String` - Takes a variety of objects to interpret as a date, and formats them using this
 instance's pattern. Inputs can include a `String` value of a number expressed in nanoseconds, a `Number` value expressed
 in nanoseconds, a JS `Date` object (necessarily in milliseconds), or a wrapped Java `long` value, expressed in 
 nanoseconds. A `TimeZone` object can optionally be provided to format this date as the current date/time in that timezone.
 * `parse(String text, TimeZone tz):Object` - Parses the given string using this instance's pattern, and returns a wrapped Java
 `long` value in nanoseconds. A `TimeZone` object can optionally be provided to parse to a desired timezone.
 * `parseAsDate(String text):Date` - Parses the given string using this instance's pattern, and returns a JS `Date`
 object in milliseconds.

###### Static functions
 * `getFormat(String pattern):DateTimeFormat` - Returns a date format instance matching the specified format. If this
 format has not been specified before, a new instance will be created and stored for later reuse.
 * `format(String pattern, Object date, TimeZone tz):String` - Accepts a variety of input objects to interpret as a date, 
 and formats them using the specified pattern. A `TimeZone` object can optionally be provided to format this date as the 
 current date/time in that timezone.See the instance method for more details on input objects. 
 * `parse(String pattern, String text, TimeZone tz):Object` - Parses the given input string using the provided pattern, and returns
 a wrapped Java `long` value in nanoseconds. A `TimeZone` object can optionally be provided to parse to a desired timezone.
 * `parseAsDate(String pattern, String text):Date` - Parses the given input string using the provided pattern, and
 returns a JS `Date` object in milliseconds.

##### Class `TimeZone`
Represents the timezones supported by Deephaven. Can be used to format dates, taking into account the offset changing
throughout the year (potentially changing each year). These instances mostly are useful at this time to pass to 
the `DateTimeFormat.format()` methods, though also support a few properties at this time to see details about each instance.

The following timezone codes are supported when getting a timezone object - instances appearing in the same line will
return the same details:

 * `GMT`/`UTC`
 * `Asia/Tokyo`
 * `Asia/Seoul`
 * `Asia/Hong_Kong`
 * `Asia/Singapore`
 * `Asia/Calcutta`/`Asia/Kolkata`
 * `Europe/Berlin`

 * `America/Halifax`
 * `America/New_York`
 * `America/Chicago`
 * `America/Denver`
 * `America/Los_Angeles`
 * `America/Anchorage`

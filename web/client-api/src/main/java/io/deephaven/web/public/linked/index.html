<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
    This example demonstrates one way that a window could open new windows, provide details as to which table to open,
    and allow linking of the tables between those windows.
</p>
<p>
    "Linking" consists of specifying two tables and building a filter that compares values in one or more columns of
    each, with one as the source, and one as the target. When a user selects a row in the source, the value of the
    specified column is used to apply a filter to the target table, so that only matching rows are displayed there.
</p>
<p>
    Each browser window in this example opens a new connection to the server. This window only opens the connection so
    that it can get the list of persistent query configs and their respective tables, but then each other window will
    also open a connection to the query worker which is running the table in question.
    <!-- TODO when it is possible to share a Client and Table connection, document how to do that -->
</p>
<p>
    As presently implemented, the individual table windows do not know about each other until a link has been
    established, so this window must remain open (and cannot be refreshed or navigated away from this page) if more
    links are to be made. This is a design choice made for this example application, but could easily be done a
    different way as needed.
</p>
<p>
    Once two windows are open, a column header from one table can be dragged to another window and dropped on a column
    header there to link them. The link will be listed on the "source" window at a list at the bottom.
</p>
<p>
    When the drop occurs, the "target" window where the header was dropped will create a MessagePort and send it in a
    message to this window (the opener for both windows), and ask it to forward the message and port to the "source"
    window. Once there, the "source" window will track that MessagePort and when any row is selected, will notify the
    "target" window through the MessagePort. The "target" window, listening for incoming messages from that MessagePort,
    will respond by taking the selected value and replacing its current filter to match the selected row in the "source"
    window.

<h3>Persistent Query Configurations</h3>
<p>
    Selecting a table will attempt to open it in a new window - to make this demo easier to use, resize the windows so
    that more than one table is visible at once.
</p>
<ul id="queries">

</ul>
<script type="module">
    import {dh} from './dh-core.js';
    const {Client} = dh;
  var url = new URL('/socket', window.location);
  if (url.protocol === 'http:') {
    url.protocol = 'ws:';
  } else {
    url.protocol = 'wss:';
  }

  window.c = new Client(url.href);
  c.addEventListener(Client.EVENT_CONNECT, () => {
    connected();
    c.login({username:'dh',token:'dh',type:'password'}).then(result => {
      console.log("login successful");
    });
  });

  var queries = document.getElementById('queries');
  var configs = Object.create(null);

  function connected() {
    c.addEventListener(Client.EVENT_CONFIG_REMOVED, event => {
      removeQuery(event.detail);
    });

      removeQuery(event.detail);
      addQuery(event.detail);
    });
    c.addEventListener(Client.EVENT_CONFIG_ADDED, event => {
      addQuery(event.detail);
    });
    function removeQuery(queryInfo) {
      var old = configs[queryInfo.serial];
      if (old) {
        var queryElt = old.elt;
        queryElt.parentNode.removeChild(queryElt);
        delete configs[queryInfo.serial];
      }
    }
    function addQuery(queryInfo) {
      console.log("config added: " + queryInfo.name);

      var queryElt = document.createElement('li');
      configs[queryInfo.serial] = {info:queryInfo, elt:queryElt};
      queryElt.innerText = queryInfo.name + ' [' + queryInfo.status + ']';
      var tables = document.createElement('ul');
      queryElt.appendChild(tables);
      queryInfo.tables.forEach(t => {
        var tableElt = document.createElement('li');
        tableElt.innerText = t;
        tables.appendChild(tableElt);
        tableElt.onclick = e => {
          e.stopPropagation();
          openTable(queryInfo.name, t);
        };
      });
      queries.appendChild(queryElt);
    }
  }

  // tracking for links between tables
  var windows = {};
  var links = [];

    //build a new url for the opened window
    var url = new URL('child.html', window.location);
    url.searchParams.set("configName", configName);
    url.searchParams.set("tableName", tableName);

    //open a window, wait for it to announce that it is ready
    var name = configName  + "." + tableName + Date.now();
    var child = window.open(url.href, name);
    windows[name] = {wnd:child, windowName:name, configName:configName, tableName:tableName};
  }

  // monitor link creation from opened tables, so it can be routed to the source window
  window.onmessage = e => {
    //TODO check the origin of this event, ensure it matches the expected pages that may communicate with us
    switch (e.data.type) {
      case "link": {
        // a link has been after the drop event occurred on another window and the filter builder completed, inform the
        // source where it should send selection events to.
        var sourceWindowName = e.data.sourceWindowName;
        var sourceColumn = e.data.sourceColumn;

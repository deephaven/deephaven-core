/**
 * <p>Regioned column source interface.
 *
 * <p>"V2" {@link io.deephaven.db.v2.SourceTable}s can be thought of a tree of partitions with
 * {@link io.deephaven.db.v2.locations.TableLocation}s at the leaf nodes. When building the
 * {@link io.deephaven.db.v2.utils.Index} for such a {@link io.deephaven.db.tables.Table}, we statically
 * partition the available element address space from [0, {@value Long#MAX_VALUE} <i>(2^63-1)</i>].
 *
 * <p>We constrain the size at these leaf nodes in order to support a partitioning of the element address space into
 * region index and sub-region element index. In order to make the calculations as inexpensive as possible, this is
 * done by assigning X bits of each index key (element address) to the region index, and the remaining Y = 63 - X to the
 * sub-region element index.
 *
 * <p>This type of address space allocation allows very cheap O(1) element access. Denser alternatives tend to
 * introduce more complication and/or O(log n) lookups.
 *
 * <p>Currently, X is 23 and Y is 40, allowing tables to consist of more than 8 million locations with more than
 * 1 trillion elements each.

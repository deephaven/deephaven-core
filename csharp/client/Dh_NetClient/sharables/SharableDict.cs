/// <summary>
/// This class implements an immutable dictionary data structure with Int64 keys and values of
/// user-specified type. The dictionary is implemented as a fixed-depth tree (the internal nodes
/// have arity 64, and the tree has depth 11). Looking up an entry by key is constant time,
/// because it traverses a fixed 11 nodes from root to leaf.
/// Looking up an entry by rank (not implemented yet) is also constant time, but the constant is larger,
/// because it needs to traverse 11 nodes but also scan children counts at every node.
/// On the other hand, simple scans like this are fast on modern CPUs.
/// Modifications to the tree are performed by making a new tree that shares most of its substructure with the old tree,
/// differing only on the path from root to new value. Callers are welcome to keep multiple versions of the dictionary
/// if their application needs to. There are no locks and no caller synchronization is required.
///
/// The major operations are called "With" and "Without". The With(k, v) method returns a new dictionary
/// which is just like the current one except it also has (new or modified) entry mapping "k" to "v". The
/// Without(key) method returns a new dictionary just like the current one except it lacks an entry for "k".
/// In the future we will provide batch versions of With and Without for greater efficiency.
///
/// There is also a "CalcDifference" operations which compares the current dictionary with another and
/// returns three dictionaries representing the difference.
///
/// The data structure is also enumerable. As with any immutable data structure, there is no concern about
/// enumerating while concurrently modifying (because there is no "modify" operation per se).

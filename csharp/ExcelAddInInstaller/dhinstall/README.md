This file is a placeholder that creates this directory in source control.

This directory is the install location (e.g. DHINSTALL) for the
Community Core dll's and the Enterprise Core Plus dll's
that get built for the installer.

We put the build output for those builds here so they can be easily found
by the installer, and they exist at a short relative location from the
Advanced Installer project itself.

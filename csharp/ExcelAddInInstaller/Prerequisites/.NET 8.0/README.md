This file is a placeholder that creates this directory in source control.

This directory is the location of the prerequisites for the Deephaven Excel
AddIn. Currently it holds the .exe file for the .NET 8.0 Windows Desktop
Runtime installer. You are meant to download this installer from Microsoft
and place it in this directory.

Instructions for doing so are in Confluence in the article entitled
"Creating a Windows MSI Installer for the Deephaven Excel Add-In (2nd gen)"

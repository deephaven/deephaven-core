# Contributing

This guide will serve as a reference for contributing to the Deephaven.

## Getting the source

Deephaven uses the [Forking Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow).  In this workflow, the [deephaven/deephaven-core](https://github.com/deephaven/deephaven-core) repository contains a minimum number of branches, and development work happens in user-forked repositories.

To learn more see:
* [Forking Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow)
* [Forking Projects](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)
* [Fork A Repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
* [Working With Forks](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/working-with-forks)

To get started quickly:
1) Navigate to [https://github.com/deephaven/deephaven-core](https://github.com/deephaven/deephaven-core).
2) Click `Fork` in the top right corner.
3) `git clone git@github.com:<username>/deephaven-core.git`
4) Commit changes to your own branches in your forked repository.

For details on working with git on GitHub, see:
* [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
* [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) 
* [Troubleshooting cloning errors](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/troubleshooting-cloning-errors)
* [Pushing commits to a remote repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository)

Forked repositories do not have access to the same tokens/secrets as the [deephaven/deephaven-core](https://github.com/deephaven/deephaven-core) repository, so GitHub actions will fail. To disable GitHub actions in your forked repository, go to "Actions" -> "Disable Actions" in your forked repository settings (`https://github.com/<username>/deephaven-core/settings/actions`).

Over time, forks will get out of sync with the upstream repository.  To stay up to date, either:
* Navigate to `https://github.com/<username>/deephaven-core` and click on `Fetch upstream`, or
* Follow these directions on [Syncing A Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork).

## Building and Running
For instructions on building and running, see [Build and launch from source](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/launch-build/).

## Creating a Pull Request
Pull requests can be created through the GitHub website or through the GitHub CLI.

### GitHub Web

Follow the directions in [Creating A Pull Request From A Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

### GitHub CLI

1) [Install GitHub command line tool](https://github.com/cli/cli).  
2) On the command line, cd into your checked-out fork/branch.
3) `gh pr create -f -w`
    * Use `deephaven/deephaven-core` as the base repository.
    * Use `<username>/deephaven-core` as the repository to push to.
4) Your changes should automatically get pushed, and then a new pull request with your changes should open up in your browser. 
5) Complete the information in the pull request and click `Create pull request`.

For more information, see:
* [gh pr create](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_pr_create)
* [CLI In Use](https://cli.github.com/manual/examples.html)

## Styleguide
The [styleguide](style/README.md) is applied globally to the entire project, except for generated code that gets checked in.
To apply the styleguide, run `./gradlew spotlessApply`.

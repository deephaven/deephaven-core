# Example integration

This module has been setup as an example for how an integrator can customize the structure and configuration of the
Deephaven server.

It is not meant to be an exhaustive example of Deephaven configuration points, nor dagger conventions, but rather as a
starting example.

## Quickstart

```shell
./gradlew server-jetty-app-custom:run -Pgroovy
```

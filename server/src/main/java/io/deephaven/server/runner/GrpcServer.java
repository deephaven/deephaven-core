/**
 * This interface handles the lifecycle of Netty and Jetty servers in a unified way, while still supporting the use
 * cases that Deephaven expects:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Deephaven wants to initiate stop early in the shutdown process, and block on it after all services have begun to
 * stop.</li>
 * <li>gRPC+Netty supports a non-blocking stop, a "stop now", and a pair of await methods, one of which takes a
 * timeout.</li>
 * <li>gRPC+Jetty supports a blocking stop with a timeout, and a join() method.</li>
 * </ul>
 * In order to not block on the initial stop call, the Jetty implementation will run stop() in another thread. Since
 * Jetty doesn't have an extra "shutdownNow" method, the Netty implementation will use the timeout in another thread to
 * decide if it needs to invoke shutdownNow when normal shutdown is taking too long.

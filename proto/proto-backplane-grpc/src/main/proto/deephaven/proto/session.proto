 * User supplied Flight.Ticket(s) should begin with 'e' byte followed by an signed little-endian int. The client is only
 * allowed to use the positive exportId key-space (client generated exportIds should be greater than 0). The client is
 * encouraged to use a packed ranges of ids as this yields the smallest footprint server side for long running sessions.
 *
 * The client is responsible for releasing all Flight.Tickets that they create or that were created for them via a gRPC
 * call. The documentation for the gRPC call will indicate that the exports must be released. Exports that need to be
 * released will always be communicated over the session's ExportNotification stream.
 *
 * When a session ends, either explicitly or due to timeout, all exported objects in that session are released
 * automatically.
 *
 * Some parts of the API return a Flight.Ticket that does not need to be released. It is not an error to attempt to
 * release them.

    # We are adding labeled and unlabeled here, so that changes to labels will cause this action to
    # be re-run.

    # Note: we need to rerun this action on new commits (synchronize events) even though it doesn't
    # effect the labels because the merge requirements need checks to pass against the most recent
    # commit.

#
# A GitHub Action to manage Contributor License Agreement (CLA) compliance.
# This action uses CLA Assistant (https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cla-assistant-lite) to ensure that
# all contributors have signed the Deephaven CLA before their PRs are merged.  
# The CLA can be signed by commenting on the PR.
#
# The CLA and all signatures are maintained at:  https://github.com/deephaven/cla
# The "main" branch of this repository must not be protected.
#
# To use this action:
# 
# 1) Copy this file to `<your_project>/.github/workflows/cla.yml`
#
# 2) PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
#
# A personal access token must be set up to allow this bot to commit to the CLA repository.  To do this:
# a) Create a personal access token with repo scope
# b) Manually add the token to your repository's secrets as PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
#
#
# 3) allowlist
#
# If a GitHub username is included in the allowlist, they will not be required to sign the CLA.  This is useful for allowing bots to contribute without a CLA.

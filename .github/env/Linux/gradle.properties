# We explicitly disable parallelism to give the single worker the maximum amount of heap space.
# Some of our tests are heavy on heap, and benefit from as much as we can give them.
# It may be best in the future to try and achieve better parallelism by enabling parallelism and
# setting the maximum heap as appropriate. For example, 2 workers x 3G, or 3 workers x 2G.

# GitHub hosted linux runner environment has 2 CPUs and 7G RAM.
#
# testParallel seems to run poorly on GH Actions, and is unable to take advantage it seems of 2
# workers.
#
# Our engine-table tests currently request 6g of heap (engine/table/build.gradle); this means we can't have more than
# 1 worker at a time.

org.gradle.parallel=false
org.gradle.workers.max=1

# Our CI JDKs should be pre-provisioned and invoked correctly,
# we shouldn't rely on gradle for any of this logic.

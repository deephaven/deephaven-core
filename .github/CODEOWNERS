# Note: there seems to be a lot of contention about the usefulness of CODEOWNERS.
# We should make sure to have a discussion before making code owners more widespread, as it
# potentially causes a lot of extra noise for developers.

# We want to make sure any changes to workflows are closely monitored, as they may have non-obvious
# security implications.

# Iris Data

This sample contains the observations about iris sepal and petal length from R A Fisher's classic 1950 paper, "The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems". The paper describes the use of observable metrics in plants to categorize plants by their variety. The data is often used to demonstrate machine learning categorization algorithms.

There are 150 observations in the data set, each with a class identifying a species of iris flower upon which the observations were made.

## Fields

The data has these fields:

- **SepalLengthCM:** length of the sepal sample in centimeters
- **SepalWidthCM:** width of the sepal sample in centimeters
- **PetalLengthCM:** length of the petal sample in centimeters
- **PetalWidthCM:** width of the petal sample in centimeters
- **Class:** One of "Iris-setosa", "Iris-versicolor", or "Iris-verginica"

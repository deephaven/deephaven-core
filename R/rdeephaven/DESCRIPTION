Description: The `rdeephaven` package provides an R API for communicating with the Deephaven server and working with Deephaven tables.
             In this release, we support connecting to the Deephaven server with three authentication methods including anonymous,
             username/password, and general key/value authentication. Once the connection has been established, we provide the tools to
             pull Deephaven tables from the server directly into R Data Frames, Tibbles, Arrow Tables, or Arrow RecordBatchReaders.
             You can also import local data with any of those types directly to the server, retrieve a reference to the new table,
             and bind it to a server-side variable so you can access it from any Deephaven client. Finally, you can run Python or Groovy
             scripts on the Deephaven server, so long as your server is equipped with that capability.

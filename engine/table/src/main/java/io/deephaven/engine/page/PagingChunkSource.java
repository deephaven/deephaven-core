 * {@link RowSequence} which will be used to uniquely specify the offsets into the ChunkSource elements on calls to
 * {@link ChunkSource#fillChunk(FillContext, WritableChunk, RowSequence)},
 * {@link ChunkSource#getChunk(GetContext, RowSequence)}, {@link ChunkSource#getChunk(GetContext, long, long)}.
 *
 * Also, a new method {@link PagingChunkSource#fillChunkAppend(FillContext, WritableChunk, RowSequence.Iterator)} is

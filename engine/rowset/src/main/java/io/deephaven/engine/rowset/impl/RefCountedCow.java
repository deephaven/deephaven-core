/**
 * <p>
 * This class enables a pattern of use where objects can be shared from multiple references/identities while they are
 * used read-only.
 *
 * Note this is not thread safe.
 *
 * A class derives from this class and users of it call getWriteRef() to obtain a reference that can be modified. That
 * may return the same object (with an increased ref count), or may return a deep copy of it if other readers of the
 * object exist. Effectively this creates a copy-on-write sharing strategy.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *
 *   class MyType extends RefCountedCow<MyType> {
 *       &#64;Override protected MyType self() { return this; }
 *       &#64;Override protected MyType copy() { ... } // return a deep copy of this object
 *
 *       ...
 *   }
 *
 *   public class UsesMyType {
 *       private MyType m;
 *
 *       public void acquire() { m.acquire(); }
 *       public void release() { m.release(); }
 *
 *       private void writeCheck() { m = m.getWriteRef(); }
 *
 *       public void someWriteOperation() {
 *           writeCheck();
 *           // regular implementation calling mutation operations on m.
 *       }
 *
 *       public void someReadOnlyOperation() {
 *           // No need to call writeCheck here.
 *       }
 *
 *       ...
 * }
 *
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Uses the "Curiously Recurring Generic Pattern"
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note this implementation does minimal concurrency protection, since it assumes it will run under the protection
 * mechanisms of live update table and its clock, ie, reads can concurrently access objects being mutated, but will
 * realize near the end their operation was invalidated by a clock change and will toss their results.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <T> A class that will extend us, to get RefCounted functionality.

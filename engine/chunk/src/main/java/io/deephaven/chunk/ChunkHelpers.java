     * Determines, when copying data from the source array to the dest array, whether the copying should proceed in the
     * forward or reverse direction in order to be safe. The issue is that (like memmove), care needs to be taken when
     * the arrays are the same and the ranges overlap. In some cases (like when the arrays are different), either
     * direction will do; in those cases we will recommend copying in the forward direction for performance reasons.
     * When srcArray and destArray refer to the array, one of these five cases applies:
     *
     * <p>
     *
     * <pre>
     * Case 1: Source starts to the left of dest, and does not overlap. Recommend copying in forward direction.
     * SSSSS
     *      DDDDD
     *
     * Case 2: Source starts to the left of dest, and partially overlaps. MUST copy in the REVERSE direction.
     * SSSSS
     *    DDDDD
     *
     * Case 3: Source is on top of dest. Recommend copying in forward direction (really, you should do nothing).
     * SSSSS
     * DDDDD
     *
     * Case 4: Source starts to the right of dest, and partially overlaps. MUST copy in the FORWARD direction.
     *   SSSSS
     * DDDDD
     *
     * Case 5: Source starts to the right of dest, and does not overlap. Recommend copying in the forward direction.
     *      SSSSS
     * DDDDD
     * </pre>
     *
     * Note that case 2 is the only case where you need to copy backwards.

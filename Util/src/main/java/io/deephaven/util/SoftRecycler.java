/**
 * This class makes a little "recycle bin" for your objects of type T. When you want an object, call borrowItem(). When
 * you do so, either a fresh T will be constructed for you, or a reused T will be pulled from the recycle bin. When you
 * are done with the object and want to recycle it, call returnItem(). This class will keep a maximum of 'capacity'
 * items in its recycle bin. Additionally, the items are held by SoftReferences, so the garbage collector may reclaim
 * them if it feels like it. The items are borrowed in LIFO order, which hopefully is somewhat cache-friendly.
 *
 * Note that the caller has no special obligation to return a borrowed item nor to return borrowed items in any
 * particular order. If your code has a need to keep a borrowed item forever, there is no problem with that. But if you
 * want your objects to be reused, you have to return them.

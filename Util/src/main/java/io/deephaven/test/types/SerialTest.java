/**
 * A JUnit category for tests that must be run in serial.
 *
 * If your test launches N or more work-heavy threads, you should be using SerialTest, since you'll likely be pegging
 * your cpu.
 *
 * That is, running a thread hog during the parallel test task just causes resource starvation, and large system-wide
 * pauses while contending to get execution time for a completely unrelated thread on the system.
 *
 * The 'testSerial' task created for these tests additionally have .mustRunAfter semantics, whereby, in order of script
 * evaluation, each testSerial.mustRunAfter allOther"testSerial"Tests, as well as .mustRunAfter
 * allOtherTestTasksNotNamed"testSerial"; that is, all testSerial tasks run after all other Test tasks are complete, and
 * then they take turns running one after another (see TestTools.groovy, #addEngineTest)
 *
 * ALL BENCHMARKS OR HEAVY-HITTER TESTS SHOULD USE @Category(SerialTest.class);
 *
 * Until better automation is delivered, you may need to edit your ModName.gradle file and add
 * TestTools.addEngineTest('Serial', false) to have this task created for you.
 *
 * Include: `dependencies { testCompile TestTools.projectDependency(project, 'Util') }` to add SerialTest to your
 * classpath if it is not available.
 *
 * To convert a JUnit 3 base test case (henceforth TestType) to JUnit 4, you must: a) annotate any testMethods() in
 * TestType with @Test (junit 3 selects test methods based on nameStartsWith("test")) b) override the JUnit 3 test case
 * into a new supertype (henceforth: AdapterType) b-1) [Required] Add a public no-op method beginning with text `test`
 * in your AdapterType, so it is a "valid JUnit 3 test" b-2) [Recommended] Add methods with @Before and @After to call
 * setUp() / tearDown() on the AdapterType field c) create a field assigned to an instance of AdapterType (you may want
 * simple instance field, an @Rule instance field, or an @ClassRule static field) c-1) If your AdapterType has
 * setUp/tearDown, and you are not using @Rule or @ClassRule, annotate methods in your TestType: Add @Before/@After in
 * TestType which calls this.adapter.setUp()/tearDown() as appropriate. d) add an appropriate junit runner. If you do
 * not need anything fancy, use: {@code @RunWith(org.junit.runners.BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.class)}.

/**
 * A JUnit category for tests that can be run in parallel.
 *
 * To convert a JUnit 3 base test case (henceforth TestType) to JUnit 4, you must: a) annotate any testMethods() in
 * TestType with @Test (junit 3 selects test methods based on nameStartsWith("test")) b) override the JUnit 3 test case
 * into a new supertype (henceforth: AdapterType) b-1) [Required] Add a public no-op method beginning with text `test`
 * in your AdapterType, so it is a "valid JUnit 3 test" b-2) [Recommended] Add methods with @Before and @After to call
 * setUp() / tearDown() on the AdapterType field c) create a field assigned to an instance of AdapterType (you may want
 * simple instance field, an @Rule instance field, or an @ClassRule static field) c-1) If your AdapterType has
 * setUp/tearDown, and you are not using @Rule or @ClassRule, annotate methods in your TestType: Add @Before/@After in
 * TestType which calls this.adapter.setUp()/tearDown() as appropriate. d) add an appropriate junit runner. If you do
 * not need anything fancy, use: {@code @RunWith(org.junit.runners.BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.class)}
 *
 * If you extend and use our existing JUnit3 test fixtures like RefreshingTableTestCase, you can use
 * {@link io.deephaven.test.junit4.JUnit4RefreshingTableTestCase} as an example.

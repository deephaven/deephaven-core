/**
 * deephaven-jpy-ext is our extension code for jpy. This code arguably could live in the
 * jpy repo itself - but the update and release process around jpy is much more complicated than
 * adding code here.
 *
 * As such, deephaven-jpy-ext has a minimal set of dependencies. It depends on fishlib io for now,
 * so we can have nice formatted output, ala LogOutputAppendable, but it's not a strict requirement.
 *
 * We shouldn't be adding any additional dependencies here, and should strive to keep the surface
 * area as minimal as possible.

    A default, systemic ExecutionContext is created when a Deephaven script session is initialized, and it is used to
    evaluate queries submitted through this script session. However, to be able to evaluate a query in a deferred
    manner, such as in a different thread from the script session thread, an application must explicitly obtain or
    build a ExecutionContext and use it as a context manager to enclose the query in the body of the with statement.

    Note that, a ExecutionContext can be shared among many threads. The most typical use pattern would be to obtain
    the script session's systemic ExecutionContext and use it to wrap a query run in a thread created by the user.

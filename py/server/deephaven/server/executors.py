"""
Support for running operations on JVM server threads, so that they can be given work from python. Initially, there
are two executors, "serial" and "concurrent". Any task that will take an exclusive UGP lock should use the serial
executor, otherwise the concurrent executor should be used. In the future there may be a "fast" executor, for use
when there is no chance of using either lock.

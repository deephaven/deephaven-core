# Deephaven Documentation Style Guide

These standards apply to all Deephaven documentation across deephaven-core, deephaven-ent, and deephaven.io.

## Writing style

**Voice:** Avoid passive voice whenever possible.

- Correct: "Deephaven parallelizes filter evaluation."
- Incorrect: "Filter evaluation is parallelized by Deephaven."

**Headings:** Use sentence case (capitalize only the first word and proper nouns).

- Correct: "## Serial execution"
- Incorrect: "## Serial Execution"

**Punctuation:** Add periods to bullet points that are complete sentences.

- Exception: Do NOT add periods in the "Related documentation" section.

## Examples

- Shorter is better.
- Use the same or similar tables/example sets within a topic to highlight differences between methods.

## Deephaven proper nouns

Capitalize these terms:

- Core+
- Enterprise
- Persistent Query
- Internal tables: Process Event Log, Query Operations Performance Log, etc.
- Processes/services: Data Import Server, Log Aggregator Service, etc.

## Page structure

- Every page (except landing pages, overviews, or blog articles) should include a "Related documentation" section at the end.
- When a method is referenced in narrative text, link it to the appropriate reference page if one exists.

## Code conventions

**Method names in prose:** Do NOT include parentheses. Use parentheses only in actual code examples.

- Correct prose: "Use `.with_serial` when your formula has side effects"
- Correct code: `col.with_serial()`
- Incorrect prose: "Use `.with_serial()` when your formula has side effects"

**Python vs Groovy:** Python uses snake_case, Groovy uses camelCase.

| Python                     | Groovy                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `.with_serial`             | `.withSerial`            |
| `.with_declared_barriers`  | `.withDeclaredBarriers`  |
| `.with_respected_barriers` | `.withRespectedBarriers` |
| `Filter.from_`             | `Filter.from`            |

**Code example tags (deephaven-core):**

- `syntax` - Show syntax without executing
- `should-fail` - Code that should execute but fail with an error
- `order=table1,table2` - Specify output table order
- `order=null` - No output to display
- `skip-test` - Skip snapshot testing

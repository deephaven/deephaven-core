 "text": "A JUnit category for tests that can be run in parallel.\n\n To convert a JUnit 3 base test case (henceforth TestType) to JUnit 4, you must:\n a) annotate any testMethods() in TestType with @Test (junit 3 selects test methods based on nameStartsWith(\"test\"))\n b) override the JUnit 3 test case into a new supertype (henceforth: AdapterType)\n b-1) [Required] Add a public no-op method beginning with text `test` in your AdapterType, so it is a \"valid JUnit 3 test\"\n b-2) [Recommended] Add methods with @Before and @After to call setUp() / tearDown() on the AdapterType field\n c) create a field assigned to an instance of AdapterType\n   (you may want simple instance field, an @Rule instance field, or an @ClassRule static field)\n c-1) If your AdapterType has setUp/tearDown, and you are not using @Rule or @ClassRule, annotate methods in your TestType:\n   Add @Before/@After in TestType which calls this.adapter.setUp()/tearDown() as appropriate.\n d) add an appropriate junit runner.  If you do not need anything fancy, use:\n @RunWith(org.junit.runners.BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.class)\n\n If you extend and use our existing JUnit3 test fixtures like LiveTableTestCase,\n you can use io.deephaven.test.junit4.JUnit4LiveTableTestCase as an example.",

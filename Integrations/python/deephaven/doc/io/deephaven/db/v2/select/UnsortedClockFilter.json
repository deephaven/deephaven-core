It\n does not require any pre-sorting of the input table, instead preserving relative order in the initial output and each\n subsequent refresh. Relative to SortedClockFilter, this implementation may require less overall storage and do less\n overall work for tables with relatively few monotonically nondecreasing ranges (that is, m (number of ranges)\n <<< n (size in rows)), but it will do more work on refresh().",

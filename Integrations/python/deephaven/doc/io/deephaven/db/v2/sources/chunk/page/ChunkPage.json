In this case, it allows you to avoid\n creating an intermediary OrderedKeys object.\n\n:param context: (io.deephaven.db.v2.sources.chunk.ChunkSource.GetContext) - A context containing all mutable/state related data used in retrieving the Chunk.\n                    In particular, the Context may be used to provide a Chunk data pool\n:param firstKey: (long) - The beginning key (inclusive) of the range to fetch in the chunk\n:param lastKey: (long) - The last key (inclusive) of the range to fetch in the chunk\n:return: io.deephaven.db.v2.sources.chunk.Chunk<? extends ChunkPage.ATTR>",

This method is\n used by PagingChunkSource.fillChunkAppend(FillContext, WritableChunk, OrderedKeys.Iterator) to determine which of its\n OrderedKeys are referencing this PagingChunkSource.\nThe default implementation assumes that only one PagingChunkSource exits for each page reference.\n That is, there is only one PagingChunkSource for OrderedKeys with the same bits outside of\n PagingChunkSource.mask().\nIt is also possible to pack multiple, non-overlapping PagingChunkSources into the same page reference.\n In this case, one typically will want to override maxRow.  An example such implementation is\n ChunkPage.\n\n:param row: (long) - Any row contained on this page.\n:return: (long) the maximum last row of this page, located in the same way as row."

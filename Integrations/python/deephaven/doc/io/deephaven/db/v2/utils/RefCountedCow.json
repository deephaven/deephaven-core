 "text": "This class enables a pattern of use where objects can be shared from multiple references/identities\n while they are used read-only.\n\n Note this is not thread safe.\n\n A class derives from this class and users of it call getWriteRef() to obtain a reference that can be modified.\n That may return the same object (with an increased ref count), or may return a deep copy of it if other readers\n of the object exist.  Effectively this creates a copy-on-write sharing strategy.\n \n\n Example:\n \n\n \n \n\n Uses the \"Curiously Recurring Generic Pattern\"\n \n\n Note this implementation does minimal concurrency protection, since it assumes\n it will run under the protection mechanisms of live update table and its clock,\n ie, reads can concurrently access objects being mutated, but will realize\n near the end their operation was invalidated by a clock change and will toss their results.",

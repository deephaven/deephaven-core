This method call is only safe to use in the following patterns:\n \n 1) If an export (or non-export) SessionState.ExportBuilder.require(io.deephaven.server.session.SessionState.ExportObject<?>...)'d this export then the method is valid from\n within the Callable/Runnable passed to SessionState.ExportBuilder.submit(java.util.concurrent.Callable<T>).\n \n 2) By first obtaining a reference to the SessionState.ExportObject, and then observing its state as\n ExportNotification.State.EXPORTED.

  "exportNotifications": "Establish a stream to manage all session exports, including those lost due to partially complete rpc calls.\n New streams will flush notifications for all un-released exports, prior to seeing any new or updated exports\n for all live exports. After the refresh of existing state, subscribers will receive notifications of new and\n updated exports. An export id of zero will be sent to indicate all pre-existing exports have been sent.\n \n\n:param request: io.deephaven.proto.backplane.grpc.ExportNotificationRequest\n:return: java.util.Iterator<io.deephaven.proto.backplane.grpc.ExportNotification>",

  "release": "Attempts to release an export by its ticket. Returns true if an existing export was found.

 "text": "User supplied Flight.Ticket(s) should begin with 'e' byte followed by an signed little-endian int. The client is only\n allowed to use the positive exportId key-space (client generated exportIds should be greater than 0). The client is\n encouraged to use a packed ranges of ids as this yields the smallest footprint server side for long running sessions.\n The client is responsible for releasing all Flight.Tickets that they create or that were created for them via a gRPC\n call. The documentation for the gRPC call will indicate that the exports must be released. Exports that need to be\n released will always be communicated over the session's ExportNotification stream.\n When a session ends, either explicitly or due to timeout, all exported objects in that session are released\n automatically.\n Some parts of the API return a Flight.Ticket that does not need to be released. It is not an error to attempt to\n release them.",

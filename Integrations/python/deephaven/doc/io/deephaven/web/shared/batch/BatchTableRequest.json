 "text": "A place to collect up table operations that can be batched. There are two ways to group operations, a single step can\n perform more than one operation, and multiple steps can be specified. Within a given step, the operations will be run\n in the default order and will only be exported to the client once, but by providing multiple steps any preferred\n order can be achieve, or intermediate tables can be exported to the client.\n\n This object is only meant for serialization; all brains to construct it are in the RequestBatcher class.",

 "text": "Writable RowRedirection.\n\n A WritableRowRedirection can be in one of two states: tracking prev values or not. The typical lifecycle looks like\n this:\n \n* A WritableRowRedirection is created with an initial map, but not tracking prev values. In this state, get() and\n getPrev() behave identically; put() and remove() affect current values but do no \"prev value\" tracking.\n * Prev value tracking begins when the caller calls startTrackingPrevValues(). Immediately after this call, the data\n is logically \"forked\": getPrev() will still refer to the same set of entries as before; this set will be frozen until\n the end of the generation.\n * Additionally, a terminal listener will be registered so that the prev map will be updated at the end of the\n generation.\n * Meanwhile, get(), put(), and remove() will logically refer to a fork of that map: it will initially have the same\n entries as prev, but it will diverge over time as the caller does put() and remove() operations.\n * At the end of the generation (when the TerminalListener runs), the prev set is (logically) discarded, prev gets\n current, and current becomes the new fork of the map.",

Note this should find a range that either contains the argument\n or, if there is no such a range, is the first range in the iterator after the argument. If a range containing the\n argument is found, and its start position is less than the argument, start is updated to the argument value.\n \n\n If no satisfying range is found, false is returned, and any subsequent call to hasNext returns false. Otherwise\n true is returned and the current range is updated\n \n\n Note the iterator is invalidated (exhausted) when this method returns false: there is no guarantee as to where\n the start and end positions are left in this case).

  "search": "Advance the current iterator (start) position while the current value maintains comp.directionFrom(v) > 0.

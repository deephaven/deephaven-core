Each record is\n then passed to the adapter class, requiring no per-record reflection.\n\n This adapter is intended for use with custom deserializers or with using Avro with compiled\n org.apache.avro.specific.SpecificRecord objects that contain a field for each schema element.\nAfter processing explicit mappings for fields; the value class is searched for exact matches followed by the key\n class using the following precedence:\n \n* a public method with a the same name as the column and no arguments\n* a public method beginning with \"get\" followed by the name of the column, and no arguments\n* a public field with the same name as the column, and no arguments\n\n If caseInsensitiveSearch is specified on the builder, the same precedence is followed for the remaining columns;\n but using case insensitive matching of method names.",

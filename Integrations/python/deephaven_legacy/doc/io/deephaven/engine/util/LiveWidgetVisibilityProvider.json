The widget itself is responsible for determining which\n data should be presented to the user and applying any appropriate viewer permissions.\n \n\n If widgets do not implement this interface, they are visible to all users of the query.\n \n\n Unlike tables, limiting the visibility of one widget does not affect the visibility of other widgets.",

 "text": "This class wraps an inner ChunkSource holding a Vector. The purpose of doing so is to apply Vector#getDirect to the\n underlying Vector values returned by the underlying ChunkSource. This is the strategy for implementing this class:\n makeGetContext() - doesn't need to change. The default implementation in our parent, namely\n DefaultChunkSource#makeGetContext, already does the right thing. getChunk() - likewise. makeFillContext() - We don't\n need to add anything to the \"inner\" context, so we just delegate to inner and return its context fillContext() - We\n first let the inner fill the chunk, then we overwrite each value (where non-null) with the result of\n Vector#getDirect() invoked on that value.",

For now we do not support refreshing tables, just zipping together tables that are already sorted and\n will not tick.\n\n To handle ticking tables; the data structures would need to be changed, we're storing everything in parallel arrays\n and to tick we would need to shift those around. Handling append only could work; but there would be a lot of\n shifting if the data arrives particularly out of order.",

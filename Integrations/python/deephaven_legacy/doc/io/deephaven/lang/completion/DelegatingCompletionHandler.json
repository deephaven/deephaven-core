 "text": "Allows you to join multiple completion handlers together, and coalesce the final results.\n\n In the future, we will better log which handlers provided which completions. We may also simply call the different\n handlers in a different manner, when the v2 implementation api changes to better support the ChunkerDocument model\n (and pushing results to client directly), rendering this class obsolete.\n\n NOTE: This class is not currently in use, since the coalesced results wound up causing ugly duplications with\n different whitespace. We will delete it after merging, to have it in git history, in case we decide to revive it\n later.",

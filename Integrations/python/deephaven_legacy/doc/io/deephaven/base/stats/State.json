 "text": "A statistic where each value represents a snapshot of the state of the system, and thus the sum of the values does\n not have any meaning. Examples include queue size and latency. If the sum of the values does have a useful\n interpretation, use Counter instead.\n \nValue.sample(long) takes a sample, recording a single value. This is the most common usage. (Value.increment(long) does\n exactly the same thing but is a poor verb to use with a State.)\n sampleFromIncrement(long) takes a sample, recording a value that is the last sample plus the given increment.\n (If no samples have yet been taken, the \"last\" sample is assumed to be 0). For example, this can be used to track a\n queue's size by calling it every time an item is added or removed.",
